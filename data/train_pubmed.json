We examined the effect of endothelin on pressure natriuresis in isolated perfused kidneys from 16-week-old SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Plasma and urinary endothelin levels in intact rats and the rate of endothelin release from isolated kidneys were also determined. Urinary sodium excretion by SHR kidneys was 60% less than by WKY rat kidneys at a given perfusion pressure. Endothelin-1 increased the renal vascular resistance dose-dependently and the change was comparable in SHR and WKY rats. A high perfusate concentration of endothelin-1 markedly reduced urinary sodium excretion, resulting in a significant rightwards shift of the pressure-natriuresis curve. However, endothelin-1 at concentrations below 0.1 nmol/l did not decrease urinary sodium excretion, despite its renal vasoconstrictory activity. In a different in vivo study, plasma endothelin-like immunoreactivity was similar in the two groups, as was the urinary endothelin excretion. However, the rate of endothelin release from isolated SHR kidneys was slightly greater than from WKY rat kidneys.",
        "Behavior": "Question: Does endothelin work as an intrarenal mechanism to alter pressure natriuresis in spontaneously hypertensive rats?",
        "answer": "Since the difference in endothelin levels is not remarkable, it seems unlikely that increased intrarenal production of endothelin plays a role in the maintenance of hypertension in SHR by modulating the pressure-natriuresis curve."

        "ContextString": "Answer the question based on the following context: Preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) is used to increase the future remnant liver (FRL) in patients requiring extensive liver resection. Computed tomography (CT) volumetry, performed not earlier than 3-6 weeks after PVE, is commonly employed to assess hypertrophy of the FRL following PVE. Early parameters to predict effective hypertrophy are therefore desirable. The aim of the present study was to assess plasma bile salt levels, triglycerides (TG), and apoA-V in the prediction of the hypertrophy response during liver regeneration. Serum bile salt, TG, and apoA-V levels were determined in 20 patients with colorectal metastases before PVE, and 5 h, 1, and 21 days after PVE, as well as prior to and after (day 1-7, and day 21) subsequent liver resection. These parameters were correlated with liver volume as measured by CT volumetry (%FRL-V), and liver function was determined by technetium-labeled mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy using single photon emission computed tomography. Triglyceride levels at baseline correlate with volume increase of the future remnant liver (FRL-V) post-PVE. Also, bile salts and TG 5 h after PVE positively correlated with the increase in FRL volume (r=0.672, p=0.024; r=0.620, p=0.042, resp.) and liver function after 3 weeks (for bile salts r=0.640, p=0.046). Following liver surgery, TG levels at 5 h and 1 day after resection were associated with liver remnant volume after 3 months (r=0.921, p=0.026 and r=0.981, p=0.019, resp). Plasma apoA-V was increased during liver regeneration.",
        "Behavior": "Question: Can plasma bile salt, triglycerides, and apoA-V levels predict liver regeneration?",
        "answer": "Bile salt and TG levels at 5 h after PVE/resection are significant early predictors of liver volume and functional increase. It is suggested that these parameters can be used for early timing of volume assessment and resection after PVE."

Anecdotally, we have observed that a number of patients with NASH carried a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. However, it is unknown if thyroid dysfunction plays any role in the pathogenesis of NASH. To further investigate this observation, we conducted a case-control study to determine the association between hypothyroidism and NASH. Cases were defined as patients with well-documented NASH attending hepatology clinics at Indiana University Hospital from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2000. Age, gender, race, and body-weight matched individuals seen during the same period in the general medical clinics served as controls. Patients with a previous diagnosis of hypothyroidism who are currently on synthetic T4 replacement were considered to be \"hypothyroid\". The strength of association was assessed by logistic regression analysis after controlling for the frequency of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. One hundred seventy-four patients with NASH (cases) and 442 controls were included. The mean age of cohort was 49 +/- 13 years, 59% were female, and 98% were white. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with NASH was 15% was significantly higher than in the controls (7.2%, P<0.001).

We studied the CT scans of adult patients with proved blunt splenic injuries to determine if the findings accurately reflect the extent of the injury. We were specifically interested in establishing if CT findings can be used to determine whether patients require surgery or can be managed conservatively. The CT scans of 45 patients with blunt splenic injuries were analyzed retrospectively, and the CT findings were correlated with the need for surgery. We used (1) a CT scale (I-V) for splenic parenchymal injuries that also allowed a comparison with the surgical findings in patients who underwent laparotomy, and (2) a CT-based score (1-6) that referred to both the extent of parenchymal injuries and the degree of hemoperitoneum. Early laparotomy was done in nine patients. Conservative treatment was attempted in 36 patients and was successful in 31; five patients needed delayed laparotomy after attempted conservative treatment. According to the CT scale (I-V), 25 patients had injuries of grade I or II; 20 patients were successfully treated conservatively, whereas five patients needed delayed surgery. Nineteen patients had injuries of grade III, IV, or V; eight patients underwent early laparotomy, and 11 patients were successfully treated conservatively. CT findings were false-negative in one patient who underwent early surgery for diaphragmatic rupture. A comparison of the CT findings with the intraoperative findings according to the CT scale (I-V) revealed identical parenchymal injury grades in four cases, whereas the injuries were underestimated on CT scans in four patients and overestimated on CT scans in six patients. The CT-based score (1-6) was applied to 41 patients; four patients who had peritoneal lavage before CT were excluded. Twelve patients had scores below 2.5; 10 patients were successfully treated conservatively, and two patients needed delayed surgery. Twenty-nine patients had scores of 2.5 or higher; six patients underwent early laparotomy, 20 patients were successfully treated conservatively, and three patients needed delayed surgery.

Even patients with splenic parenchymal injuries of CT grade III, IV, and V and with CT-based scores of 2.5 or higher can be successfully treated conservatively if the clinical situation is appropriate, whereas delayed splenic rupture can still develop in patients with low CT grades or scores. The choice between operative and nonoperative management of splenic trauma should be mainly based on clinical findings rather than CT findings."

Based on Cox proportional hazard models, and the results of imaging studies low and high risk groups are identified and a risk adjusted follow-up protocol is proposed. The risk of a recurrence was related to increasing pT, tumour positive lymph nodes, tumour positive surgical margins, and pre-operative dilatation of the upper urinary tract, and low and high risk groups were defined consequently. 84% of all recurrences occurred within 2 years, with only one recurrence beyond 2 years in the low risk group.

The aim of the study was to describe the transcriptomic profiles of differently polarized human macrophages to generate new hypotheses on the biological function of the different macrophage subtypes. Polarization of circulating monocytes/macrophages of blood donors was induced in vitro by IFN-\u03b3 and LPS (M1), by IL-4 (M2a), and by IL-10 (M2c). Unstimulated cells (RM) served as time controls. Gene expression profile of M1, M2a, M2c and RM was assessed at 6, 12 and 24h after polarization with Whole Human Genome Agilent Microarray technique. When compared to RM, M1 significantly upregulated pathways involved in immunity and inflammation, whereas M2a did the opposite. Conversely, decreased and increased expression of mitochondrial metabolism, consistent with insulin resistant and insulin sensitive patterns, was seen in M1 and M2a, respectively. The time sequence in the expression of some pathways appeared to have some specific bearing on M1 function. Finally, canonical and non-canonical Wnt genes and gene groups, promoting inflammation and tissue remodeling, were upregulated in M2a compared to RM.",

Epidemiological and experimental evidence has shown that impaired maternal nutrition in utero results in an adverse postnatal phenotype for the offspring. Placental mitochondrial function might link maternal food intake to fetal growth since impaired placental ATP production, in response to poor maternal nutrition, could be a pathway linking maternal food intake to reduced fetal growth. We assessed the effects of maternal diet on placental water content, ATP levels and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content in mice at embryonic (E) day 18 (E18). Females maintained on either low- (LPD) or normal- (NPD) protein diets were mated with NPD males. Fetal dry weight and placental efficiency (embryo/placental fresh weight) were positively correlated (r = 0.53, P = 0.0001). Individual placental dry weight was reduced by LPD (P = 0.003), as was the expression of amino acid transporter Slc38a2 and of growth factor Igf2. Placental water content, which is regulated by active transport of solutes, was increased by LPD (P = 0.0001). However, placental ATP content was also increased (P = 0.03).\n\nTo investigate the possibility of an underlying mitochondrial stress response, we studied cultured human trophoblast cells (BeWos).

The oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood does not include the effect of pulmonary tissue oxygen uptake. Thus, oxygen consumption (VO2) of the lung should be reflected as a difference between VO2 measured by gas exchange and VO2 derived by the Fick principle. The purpose of this study was to measure in clinical conditions this difference (taken to represent the VO2 of the lung), and to evaluate the sources of error in lung VO2 estimation. Nine patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were studied. VO2 was measured by indirect calorimetry (VO2gasex) and compared to Fick-derived VO2 (VO2Fick) after induction of anaesthesia, after closure of the chest, at admission to intensive care, after stabilization of haemodynamics and during weaning from mechanical ventilation. The Fick-derived VO2 was calculated from blood samples taken at the beginning and at the end of each 20 min measurement period, and the mean of 12 consecutive thermodilution cardiac output measurements taken during each 20 min measurement period. VO2gasex was higher than VO2Fick (P<0.01; in all except 4 of 45 measurements). The difference between the measured and the calculated VO2 was 33 +/- 25 ml/min (mean +/- SD, range -16-100 ml/min). This difference represented 14 +/- 3% (range 11-18%) of the whole body VO2.

A major flaw in the design of previous studies may have contributed to disappointing results: many subjects are not truly episodic in the nature of their headaches-they discount days with mild headache and ignore days with migraine-related neck pain. Believing that neck pain is integrally related to migraine, we sought to ascertain whether early treatment with sumatriptan 85/naproxen sodium 500 (sumatriptan/naproxen) in truly episodic migraineurs is more robust than results when neck pain has not been considered. Successfully screened adult migraineurs who returned baseline diaries showing 2 to 7 migraine attacks monthly and<15 headache and/or neck pain days/month received blister packs containing 3 sumatriptan/naproxen/1 placebo for treatment of 4 migraines. Instructions were to treat within the first 30 minutes of mild headache or neck discomfort-but only if the preceding day was completely free of both headache and neck pain. In our study, 63.9% of patient attacks treated with sumatriptan/naproxen achieved 2-hour pain freedom compared with 33.3% of those with placebo (P<0.001). Sustained pain freedom (2-24 hours) was achieved in 69.1% of sumatriptan/naproxen-treated attacks, compared with 23.3% with placebo (P<0.01). More subjects using sumatriptan/naproxen achieved sustained pain freedom (than 2-hour pain freedom), due to 6 time points when the subject was sleeping/napping 2-hours post dose (5 sumatriptan/naproxen, 1 placebo), yet attested to no discomfort between 2 and 24 hours post dose. Had the attacks been scored as pain-free at 2 hours, the 2-hour pain-free and sustained pain-free rates with sumatriptan/naproxen would have been identical at 69.1% (vs 36.7% with placebo).

As part of a larger 5-year study to measure the impact of the legislation in Scotland, an audit was conducted to assess level and nature of compliance with the ban immediately following its introduction. A discreet observational audit was conducted 7-14 days post implementation which took measures of physical changes made to cover products, server/assistant practices, tobacco signage and advertising, and communication of price information. The audit was conducted in all small retail outlets (n = 83) selling tobacco in four communities in Scotland selected to represent different levels of urbanisation and social deprivation. Data were analysed descriptively. Compliance with the legislation was high, with 98% of shops removing tobacco from permanent display and non-compliance was restricted almost entirely to minor contraventions. The refurbishment of shops with new or adapted tobacco storage units resulted in the removal of nearly all commercial brand messages and images from POS, dropping from 51% to 4%. The majority of shops stored their tobacco in public-facing storage units (81%). Most shops also displayed at least one generic tobacco message (88%).",

However, although tobacco branding is no longer visible in retail outlets, tobacco storage units with generic tobacco messages are still prominent. This points towards a need to monitor how the space vacated by tobacco products is utilised and to better understand how the continuing presence of tobacco storage units influences people's awareness and understanding of tobacco and smoking. Countries with existing POS bans and who are considering such bans should pay particular attention to regulations regarding the use of generic signage and where within the retail setting tobacco stocks can be stored."

Statistical analyses included chi-square, Bonferroni-adjusted P values, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and logistic regressions including key demographic factors, patient age, and error reversibility. The response rate was 40% (474 of 1186). Overall, 98% of respondents believed it was very important to disclose medical errors to parents versus 57% to pediatric patients (P<.0001).

Participants were asked to determine whether low-pass filtered sentences matched unfiltered target sentences. Filtered sentences either matched the target sentence exactly or differed on between 1 and 3 parameters that affected the prosodic profile of the sentences. Children with SLI were significantly poorer than their normal peers in determining whether low-pass filtered sentences matched or were different from unfiltered target sentences. The children's performance, measured in terms of response accuracy, deteriorated as the similarities between filtered and unfiltered sentences increased.

Therefore, identification of novel pretreatment assays to predict outcome is of interest. In HNC there are indications that pretreatment tumour (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake may be an independent prognostic factor. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of FDG uptake and CT-based and FDG PET-based primary tumour volume measurements in patients with HNC treated with (chemo)radiotherapy. A total of 77 patients with stage II-IV HNC who were eligible for definitive (chemo)radiotherapy underwent coregistered pretreatment CT and FDG PET. The gross tumour volume of the primary tumour was determined on the CT (GTV(CT)) and FDG PET scans. Five PET segmentation methods were applied: interpreting FDG PET visually (PET(VIS)), applying an isocontour at a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2.5 (PET(2.5)), using fixed thresholds of 40% and 50% (PET(40%), PET(50%)) of the maximum intratumoral FDG activity (SUV(MAX)) and applying an adaptive threshold based on the signal-to-background (PET(SBR)). Mean FDG uptake for each PET-based volume was recorded (SUV(mean)). Subsequently, to determine the metabolic volume, the integrated SUV was calculated as the product of PET-based volume and SUV(mean). All these variables were analysed as potential predictors of local control (LC), regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). In oral cavity/oropharynx tumours PET(VIS) was the only volume-based method able to predict LC. Both PET(VIS) and GTV(CT) were able to predict DMFS, DFS and OS in these subsites.

We hypothesized that sample size calculations may not be performed consistently in surgery studies and, therefore, many studies may be \"underpowered.\" To address this issue, we reviewed RCTs published in the surgical literature to determine how often sample size calculations were reported and to analyze each study's ability to detect varying degrees of differences in outcomes. A comprehensive MEDLINE search identified RCTs published in Annals of Surgery, Archives of Surgery, and Surgery between 1999 and 2002. Each study was evaluated by two independent reviewers. Sample size calculations were performed to determine whether they had 80% power to detect differences between treatment groups of 50% (large) and 20% (small), with one-sided test, alpha = 0.05.

The simultaneous detection of 18 known HFE, TFR2 and FPN1 mutations and sequencing of the HAMP gene were performed to rule out the possible existence of genetic modifier factors related with iron overload. Values of biochemical iron overload, measured as percentage TS and serum ferritin concentration (SF), in our H63D homozygotes were significantly higher in patients than in controls: TS 55 +/- 15% vs. 35 +/- 15% and SF 764 (645-883) microg/L vs. 115 (108-123) microg/L for patients and controls, respectively. These H63D homozygotes presented extreme hyperferritinaemia and no additional mutations in HFE, TFR2, FPN1 and HAMP genes were detected.",

        "answer": "The lack of additional mutations in our H63D homozygotes suggests that this genotype could be the primary cause of iron overload in these patients. Despite our results, we cannot entirely discount the possibility that one or more genetic modifier factor exists, simply because we were unable to find it, although there was a precedent in the HFE gene. Genetic modifier factors have been described for C282Y mutations in the HFE gene, but at the present time they have never been reported in H63D homozygotes."

A total of 225 CPPs completed a series of rating scales and yes/no questions relating to their preinjury job perceptions and a question relating to intent to return to the same type of preinjury job post-pain facility treatment. The CPPs were broken down into subgroups (males, females, college males, noncollege males, college females, noncollege females), and within each subgroup those not intending to return to the same type of pre-injury job were compared to those intending to return on the preinjury job perception questions. In addition for the whole group, stepwise discriminant analysis was used to predict who planned to return to the preinjury job utilizing the job perceptions questions. Multidisciplinary Pain Center. Consecutive chronic pain patients. For the whole group, CPPs not intending to return were more likely to complain of job excessive physical demands, job satisfaction, and job dislike. Job perception complaints that were significantly different between the intending and not intending to return groups differed between the subgroups. For example, noncollege males not intending to return were more likely to complain of excessive physical demands only versus satisfaction and liking as significant items for college males who did not intend to return. Within the discriminant analysis, the combination of job satisfaction, excessive physical demands, employee conflicts, job liking, job dangerousness, supervisory conflicts, job stress, and age classified 73.46% of the CPPs correctly as to intent to return to the same type of preinjury job.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the BRIEF is indeed a useful screening instrument in monitoring of adults with PKU. Adult PKU patients (n = 55; mean age 28.3 \u00b1 6.2 years) filled out the BRIEF-A (higher scores=poorer EF) and performed computerized tasks measuring executive functions (inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and working memory). The outcome of the BRIEF-A questionnaire was compared with the neurocognitive outcome as measured by three tasks from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT). Forty-two percent of the PKU patients scored in the borderline/clinical range of the BRIEF-A. Six of the 55 patients (11%) scored>1 SD above the normative mean, mostly on the Metacognition Index. With respect to ANT measurements, patients mainly showed deficits in inhibitory control (34-36%) and cognitive flexibility (31-40%) as compared to the general Dutch population. No significant correlations between the two methods were found, which was confirmed with the Bland-Altman approach where no agreement between the two methods was observed.

We collected information on Gleason score and cancer volume (CV) for all tumour localizations, clinical and pathological stage, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and extra capsular extension (ECE). In case one pattern was seen in more than 95% of the tumour, this pattern was used both for the primary and secondary Gleason pattern, and any other pattern (actually the secondary pattern) was called tertiary. Charts were examined retrospectively for clinical follow up. PSA progression was defined as two subsequent rising PSA measurements above 0.10 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier time to PSA progression was compared between patients with and without a tertiary pattern. Overall, of the 223 patients, 106 (48%) were found to have a tertiary pattern, which on average, was 7% of the total tumour volume. Patients with a tertiary pattern had a 5-year risk of PSA progression of 37.3% versus 12.6% in case no tertiary Gleason pattern was present (log rank p=0.0002).

The sample included 372 newlywed individuals recruited from marriage license records. Participants completed a number of self-report questionnaires measuring the nature and severity of child maltreatment history, perceived social support from friends and family, and trauma-related symptoms. These questionnaires were part of a larger study, investigating marital and intrapersonal functioning. We conducted separate, two-step hierarchical multiple regression models for perceived social support from family and perceived social support from friends. In each of these models, total trauma symptomatology was predicted from each child maltreatment severity variable, perceived social support, and the product of the two variables. In order to examine the role of gender, we conducted separate analyses for women and men. As hypothesized, increased severity of several maltreatment types (sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect) predicted greater trauma symptoms for both women and men, and increased physical abuse severity predicted greater trauma symptoms for women. Perceived social support from both family and friends predicted lower trauma symptoms across all levels of maltreatment for men. For women, greater perceived social support from friends, but not from family, predicted decreased trauma symptoms. Finally, among women, perceived social support from family interacted with child maltreatment such that, as the severity of maltreatment (physical and emotional abuse, emotional neglect) increased, the buffering effect of perceived social support from family on trauma symptoms diminished.",

        "answer": "Shunt series detected catheter pathology only 3.9% of the time, and there was no difference in the rate of management changes between those patients who underwent a shunt series and those who did not. There was a significant difference in the rate of management changes in patients who received shunt patency studies as compared to those who did not. Shunt series may not be a useful screening tool to be used universally to diagnose shunt malfunction in IIH patients in the ED, and should be utilized when there is concern for impending visual loss. Shunt patency studies should be reserved for patients with inconclusive diagnostic imaging and clinical findings to decide whether to proceed to surgical exploration and revision."

All consecutive trauma patients with coagulopathy (international normalized ratio [INR] \u22651.5) secondary to oral anticoagulants who received either 3F-PCC or 4F-PCC from 2010 to 2014 at 2 trauma centers were reviewed. Efficacy was determined by assessing the first INR post-PCC administration, and successful reversal was defined as INR less than 1.5. Safety was assessed by reviewing thromboembolic events, and cost-effectiveness was calculated using total treatment costs (drug acquisition plus transfusion costs) per successful reversal. Forty-six patients received 3F-PCC, and 18 received 4F-PCC. Baseline INR was similar for 3F-PCC and 4F-PCC patients (3.1 \u00b1 2.3 vs 3.4 \u00b1 3.7, P = .520).

Further understanding of the factors involved in increasing donation rates is very important for planning future strategies to improve outcomes in each country. With this purpose we analyzed the relationship between social and economic factors of the countries and organizational aspects of health systems and institutions dedicated to transplantation in relation to the number of actual donors per million population. We analyzed rates of deceased donors per million population of Latin America, North America, and Europe (20 countries) and correlated them with the human development index and its most important indicators. We also studied the correlation with spending on health and organizational aspects of the health system. On the one hand, we found that donation rates (DRs) per million population (pmp) were not statistically significantly correlated with the human development index (significant correlation 0.61 and 0.181). There is a correlation, albeit weak, between observed donation rates and gross domestic product (GDP) of each country (significance, 0.04; correlation, 0.46).

T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained during routine clinical imaging at 1.5T in ALS patients with frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) (n=18) and in unaffected neurologic controls (n=15). Gray matter (GM) VBM analysis was carried out using FMRIB software library (FSL) 4.1.5 and statistical parametric mapping 8 (SPM8). Comparison of processing steps segmentation, registration, and statistical methods (nonparametric vs. parametric) between the two softwares was performed by subjecting the same dataset through standard VBM processing pipelines. GM volume was significantly (P<0.05) reduced in motor and extramotor regions of ALS-FTD when compared to controls. Percentage of atrophied GM voxels in the entire brain that reached statistical significance using FSL was 22.52% compared to 0.81% in SPM.

The authors considered that existing studies on CO(2) therapy were not sufficient to exhibit the efficiency of CO(2) therapy. The scientific basis for evaluating CO(2) therapy including standard dietary regimen, standard daily physical effort, and standard psychosocial stimuli was not clear. Despite this unclear situation, CO(2) therapy is extremely popular worldwide. The authors designed an experimental study using histomorphologic examination and the laser-Doppler flow meter to monitor treated tissue in rats. They devised a controlled applicator device appropriate for gas injection of rats and compared biochemical effects between CO(2) and breathable air. In this study, 28 female Wistar rats weighing 300\u00a0g were divided into five groups: sham group, acute effect of CO(2) group, acute effect of breathable air group, chronic effect of CO(2) group, and chronic effect of breathable air group. Gas was injected into the right groin of the rats via a specially designed device. The bulging disappeared after approximately 30\u00a0min in the CO(2) injection groups but continued for more than 48\u00a0h in breathable air injection groups. The blood flow and velocity in terms of changes in the signals observed using the laser-Doppler technique did not demonstrate a significant increase in the values of the gas injection groups compared with the sham group 1. A statistical difference in the number of adipocytes was found between the groups.",

        "answer": "The study findings demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in adipocyte diameters during both the early and late phases of the subjects injected with CO(2). With adipocyte volume defined as an achievement, CO(2) therapy was found to be more successful than air injection. Furthermore, compared with the control group, the decrease in adipocyte volume also was statistically significant in breathable air injected groups (groups 3 and 5). This result suggests that the mechanical effects of gas injection are more important than the metabolic effects."

We postulated that the highest failure rate with seizure prophylaxis would occur in patients with the highest body mass index. After discarding 6 patients, this study was performed in 194 of 200 preeclamptic patients admitted to our high risk pregnancy unit between February 2000 and August 2000, who were divided into four groups determined by body mass indices. A standard magnesium sulfate infusion protocol (loading dose 4.5 g/15 minutes followed by 1.8 g/hour) was administered to 194 preeclamptic patients. One hundred and thirty-eight severe preeclamptic patients received magnesium sulfate during both antepartum and postpartum periods. The remaining 56 patients only received the therapy during the postpartum period. Serial serum magnesium levels of each groups were recorded and compared. The 1.8 g infusion rate produced acceptable magnesium levels in the majority of patients but most were in the lower 50% of the therapeutic range. Levels were lowest in patients with high body mass indices (this group recorded most of the subtherapeutic levels, particularly when patient were infused antepartum). Apart from 13 referred patients who had convulsed prior to admission no eclampsia occurred during the antepartum period while seizures occurred in nine women during the postpartum period. Two hours after the initiation of the therapy, magnesium levels were inversely related to the body mass index (BMI) both during the ante- and postpartum periods (Prepartum; group I: 5.97 mg/dl, group II: 4.90 mg/dl, group III: 4.35 mg/dl, group IV: 3.88 mg/dl; Postpartum; group I: 5.89 mg/dl, group II: 5.71 mg/dl, group III: 4.82 mg/dl and group IV: 4.61 mg/dl, Table 4). Although the lowest levels were detected in patients with high body mass indices, in contrast to our hypothesis, eclamptic seizures occurred in four patients with low body mass indices. Furthermore therapeutic serum magnesium levels were detected in three of these patients. There was no association between treatment failures and body mass or with magnesium levels.",

        "answer": "The infusion regimen described herein resulted in therapeutic levels in the majority of patients that correlated inversely with body mass index. However most levels fell within the lower range of what many studies consider \"therapeutic\" suggesting that maintenance infusion rates of at least 2-2.5 g/hour would be more appropriate. This would be particularly true in patients with body mass indices exceeding 30, where subtherapeutic levels occurred most frequently. The study's limited power prevents conclusions on outcomes but what is of interest is that eclamptic convulsions did not correlate with either body mass index or circulating plasma magnesium levels."

Single-stage revision is a potential alternative to the standard two-stage procedure because it involves only one surgical procedure, so if it is comparably effective, it would be associated with less patient morbidity and lower cost.QUESTIONS/ We compared (1) the degree to which our protocol of a highly selective single-stage revision approach achieved infection control compared with a two-stage revision approach to TKA infections; and (2) Knee Society scores and radiographic evidence of implant fixation between the single-stage and two-stage patients who were treated for more complicated infections. Between 2004 and 2009, we treated 102 patients for chronic TKA infections, of whom 28 (27%) were treated using a single-stage approach and 74 (73%) were treated using a two-stage approach. All patients were available for followup at a minimum of 3 years (mean, 6.5 years; range, 3-9 years). The indications for using a single-stage approach were minimal/moderate bone loss, the absence of immunocompromise, healthy soft tissues, and a known organism with known sensitivities for which appropriate antibiotics are available. Participants included 38 men and 64 women with a mean age of 65 years (range, 45-87 years). We used the Musculoskeletal Infection Society definition of periprosthetic joint infection to confirm infection control at the last followup appointment. Radiographs were evaluated for signs of loosening, and patients completed Knee Society Scores for clinical evaluation. None of the patients in the single-stage revision group developed recurrence of infection, and five patients (93%) in the two-stage revision group developed reinfection (p=0.16). Patients treated with a single-stage approach had higher Knee Society scores than did patients treated with the two-stage approach (88 versus 76, p<0.001).

Retinal vascular calibre was measured from digital retinal photographs using computerized methods in 51 RA patients and 51 age- and gender-matched controls. Retinal vascular calibre was compared between RA and control patients with adjustment for relevant variables including cardiovascular risk factors and companion vessel calibre. The relationship between retinal venular calibre and inflammation was assessed by comparing controls and RA patients with high and lower disease activity.

Although declines in teen pregnancy and birthrates in the 1990s have been welcome news to those interested in adolescent health and welfare, the reasons for these declines are not readily apparent. Previous attempts to explain these declines focused on the period before 1995 and did not directly calculate the impact of improved contraceptive use. The national Youth Risk Behavior Survey provided estimates for sexual activity and contraceptive use among teens aged 15-17 years between 1991 and 2001 (n = 31,058). These data were combined with method-specific contraceptive failure rates (CFRs) derived from the 1988 and 1995 National Survey of Family Growth and pregnancy rates from the National Vital Statistics System. We calculated weighted-average CFRs (WACFR) and used the annual rate of change in the WACFR and sexual activity to estimate their relative contributions to the annual change in risk of pregnancy. Weighted least-squares regression in SUDAAN was used to test change over time. Between 1991 and 2001, annual rates of change in sexual behaviors were -1.7% for sexual experience and -1.6% for the WACFR. Improvements in WACFR resulted primarily from a decline in use of withdrawal (from 20% to 13%) and use of no method (from 17% to 13%) and an increase in condom use (40% to 51%). Recent sexual intercourse (i.e., intercourse during the past 3 months among teens who had ever had intercourse) did not change over time. The change in the estimated risk of pregnancy closely approximated the annual decline in the pregnancy rates for blacks and Hispanics but underestimated the actual decline for whites. Overall, 53% of the decline in pregnancy rates can be attributed to decreased sexual experience (95%CI 26% to 79%) and 47% to improved contraceptive use (95%CI 21% to 74%).",

Care should be taken in attributing changes in pregnancy rates to changes in behavior, given broad confidence intervals around these estimates.

Univariate and multivariate analysis of possible risk factors for development of sepsis after TRUS biopsy were performed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0. Ninety (51%) men received PPNB and 87 (49%) did not. The groups were matched in age (PPNB: mean 62.7 \u00b1 5.8 years; without PPNB: mean 64.4 \u00b1 5.7 years) and prebiopsy prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (PPNB: mean 8.2 \u00b1 3.9 ng/mL; without PPNB: mean 8.3 \u00b1 3.7 ng/mL). The PPNB group had a larger prostate volume, with more cores taken (P<0.05). On univariate and multivariate analysis controlling for age, PSA, prostate volume, number of cores taken and histological prostatitis, PPNB was not a significant risk factor for sepsis. Sepsis rates were 5.6% in the PPNB group and 5.7% in the other group (P = 0.956). Overall prostate cancer detection rate was 33.3%.",

        "ContextString": "Answer the question based on the following context: Although changes in contractility are often accompanied by changes in relaxation, a mathematical model of ventricular coupling has not been described. A model we examined suggests a hyperbolic relation between measurements of contraction and relaxation. We thus tested the hypothesis that relatively load-independent measurements of contractility (end-systolic elastance [Ees]) and relaxation (the slope of the tau-to-end-systolic pressure relation [R]) were coupled. To establish the validity of the model, an assessment of Ees and R was made in 30 subjects who underwent sequential digital ventriculography and micromanometer pressure measurements during atrial pacing (93 +/- 10 min-1) before and after graded doses of nitroprusside. To establish if a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated intervention alters coupling, seven of the 30 subjects were studied before and after 3 months of beta-blockade. To determine if a non-cAMP-mediated intervention alters coupling, 12 other patients were studied before and after deslanoside. Nonlinear regression analysis for the initial 30 patients suggested a hyperbolic relation: (Ees) (R) = 1.05 (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001) with an inflection point near Ees = 1.02 mm Hg/ml. Thus, with normal or near-normal contractility, relaxation is normal and not load dependent (R is close to 0). With systolic dysfunction, relaxation becomes very afterload dependent and so must be normalized for load. After long-term beta-blockade in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, small improvements in contractility (elastance) occurred with larger changes in relaxation, but the curve describing the relation was not displaced. Acute administration of deslanoside resulted in a large increase in elastance and a smaller change in relaxation but did not alter coupling. However, the magnitude of the change in R was dependent on the predrug R value.",
        "Behavior": "Question: Are contraction and relaxation coupled in patients with and without congestive heart failure?",
        "answer": "These data suggest contraction and relaxation may be physiologically coupled with relaxation relatively preserved in early heart failure and more rapid deterioration in relaxation as elastance falls under 1.02 mm Hg/ml. Both beta-blockers (which may act through cAMP) and digitalis (which is cAMP independent) improve contraction and relaxation, but both mechanisms appear to maintain coupling. The hyperbolic relation between contraction and relaxation may have important implications regarding therapeutic response and selection of patients for clinical trials in heart failure."

When the neonate's skin sensor was scheduled for routine site change, 3 new skin sensors were placed-1 each on the right upper abdomen, left flank, and right axilla. The neonate was placed in a supine position and redressed or rewrapped if previously dressed or wrapped. Subjects served as their own controls, with temperatures measured at all 3 skin sensor sites and followed by a digital thermometer measurement in the left axilla. The order of skin sensor temperature measurements was randomly assigned by a computer-generated number sequence.

We included 1119 subjects with PAH. The median (interquartile range) age was 48 years (37-59 years), and 23% were men. A total of 656 patients (59%) received active therapy (101 [15%] iloprost, 118 [18%]sitaxsentan, 204 [31%] sildenafil, and 233 [36%]subcutaneous treprostinil). Active treatment significantly lowered right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance and increased cardiac output and index (P<0.01 for all). Changes in hemodynamic values (except for right atrial pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure) were significantly associated with the risk of a clinical event (P<0.02 for all). Although active treatment approximately halved the odds of a clinical event compared with placebo (P<0.001), changes in hemodynamics accounted for only 1.2% to 13.9% of the overall treatment effect.",

Treatment plans and postimplant computed tomography scans for 20 PBSI patients were spatially registered and used to evaluate differences between planned and implanted seed positions, termed seed displacements. For each patient, the mean total and directional seed displacements were determined in both standard room coordinates and in needle coordinates relative to needle insertion angle. Seeds were labeled according to their proximity to the anatomy within the breast, to evaluate the influence of anatomic regions on seed placement. Dosimetry within an evaluative target volume (seroma + 5\u00a0mm), skin, breast, and ribs was evaluated to determine the impact of seed placement on the treatment. The overall mean (\u00b1SD) difference between implanted and planned positions was 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0mm for the aggregate seed population. No significant systematic directional displacements were observed for this whole population. However, for individual patients, systematic displacements were observed, implying that intrapatient offsets occur during the procedure. Mean displacements for seeds in the different anatomic areas were not found to be significantly different from the mean for the entire seed population. However, small directional trends were observed within the anatomy, potentially indicating some bias in the delivery.

A meta-analysis of all observational studies reporting a comparison between the two techniques in elderly patients (>70 years) between 1999-2003 was performed. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. The quality of each study was evaluated by examining three items: patient selection, matching of the off-pump and cardiopulmonary bypass patient groups, and assessment of outcome. Meta-regression analysis was undertaken to see the effects of study size and quality on the calculated odds ratio. Eight studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria, all of which were nonrandomized. In total the studies identified 3017 subjects, of which 764 had off-pump surgery (25%) and 2253 underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (75%). Meta-analysis showed that after off-pump surgery there was a significantly lower incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in these patients (odds ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.89).

This study explores whether academic performance and professional behaviours that are important in a health professional context can be predicted by these measures, when taken before or very early in the medical course. This prospective cohort study follows the progress of the entire student cohort who entered Hull York Medical School in September 2007, having taken the UKCAT cognitive tests in 2006 and the non-cognitive tests a year later. This paper reports on the students' first and second academic years of study. The main outcome measures were regular, repeated tutor assessment of individual students' interpersonal skills and professional behaviour, and annual examination performance in the three domains of recall and application of knowledge, evaluation of data, and communication and practical clinical skills. The relationships between non-cognitive test scores, cognitive test scores, tutor assessments and examination results were explored using the Pearson product-moment correlations for each group of data; the data for students obtaining the top and bottom 20% of the summative examination results were compared using Analysis of Variance. Personal qualities measured by non-cognitive tests showed a number of statistically significant relationships with ratings of behaviour made by tutors, with performance in each year's objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), and with themed written summative examination marks in each year. Cognitive ability scores were also significantly related to each year's examination results, but seldom to professional behaviours. The top 20% of examination achievers could be differentiated from the bottom 20% on both non-cognitive and cognitive measures.",

We hypothesized that osteomalacia could be a risk factor for BRONJ in patients taking NBPs. Therefore, we looked for static and dynamic histomorphometric evidence of osteomalacia in biopsies from subjects with and without BRONJ. This case-control study used histomorphometric analysis of bone specimens of patients using NBPs (22 patients with BRONJ and 21 patients without BRONJ) who required oral surgical interventions for the treatment/prevention of osteonecrosis.

The variation between regions within countries was tested for relationships with the mean region population size and the unequal distribution of populations within each country measured using Gini coefficients. There is evidence that countries whose regions vary more in population size show greater variation and hence greater apparent inequalities in mortality counts. The Gini coefficient, measuring inequalities in population size, ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 between countries; an increase of 0.1 was accompanied by a 12-14% increase in the standard deviation of the mortality rates between regions within a country.",

To determine the effect of external stenting on the innervation of porcine vein grafts. Saphenous vein into carotid artery grafting (with and without external stents) was performed in 16 pigs. After one and six months, grafts were removed, nerves were counted, and neointima was assessed. In vein graft compared to ungrafted vein, there was a significant (p<0.05) decrease in medial perivascular nerves, but a dramatic increase in paravascular nerves in the adventitia (p<0.05). In stented vein grafts there was also a reduction of perivascular nerves and the paravascular nerve proliferation observed in vein grafts at one month was inhibited (p<0.05). Neointima formation and the appearance of large paravascular nerve bundles in the adventitia of vein grafts were abolished by external stenting.",

Liver biopsies were evaluated for fibrosis, qualitatively, by Ishak score and quantitatively by fibrosis area fraction (FAF) using digital image analysis (morphometry). LSM was correlated with fibrosis and other studied variables using spearman correlation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was also performed to examine independent factors associated with LSM. Different cut-off values of LSM were calculated for predicting individual fibrosis stages using receiver-operating characteristic curve. Cut-off values with optimal clinical performance (optimal sensitivity and specificity simultaneously) were selected. The majority of HCV group had minimal activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). On the other hand, the majority of AIH group had mild to moderate activity (70%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (95%) and all Wilson disease group had mild to moderate activity (100%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (100%).

A group of 56 children, undergoing nasendoscopy to determine adenoidal size, were randomized into two groups and received either lignocain 2% and oxymetazoline 0.025% or oxymetazoline 0.025% alone prior to fibreoptic nasendoscopy. A tertiary care Paediatric Hospital. The endoscopist recorded the ease of performance of the procedure, cooperation of patient and quality of the view achieved using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The pain and anxiety levels of the child were recorded before, during and immediately after the procedure, using a VAS. The duration of performing the procedure was recorded from insertion of the endoscope into the nostril until removal. All 56 children were able to undergo the endoscopy and the full anxiety and pain assessment was done. Three children were excluded because they have undergone nasendoscopies before. Of the 53 patients included, 27 children received solution A (oxymetazoline 0.025%) and 26 children received solution B (oxymetazoline 0.025% and lignocain 2%).

The mean number of resected (positive) lymph nodes was 17 (seven). 78 patients received adjuvant systemic treatment(s). Patients treated with locoregional RT had significantly more often lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI; 63% vs. 28%; p = 0.003), T3/T4 tumors (43% vs. 17%; p = 0.014), and four or more positive lymph nodes (91% vs. 46%; p<0.001) than patients irradiated only locally. Disease progression occurred in 24/81 patients (locoregional RT: 26% vs. local RT: 33%). The above risk factors were highly significant of worse outcome. Despite their overrepresentation in the locoregional RT group, no difference was found between both groups in regard to disease-free survival (DFS; p = 0.83) and overall survival (OS; p = 0.56), suggesting that regional RT was able to counterbalance the increased risk. There was even a trend toward a better 3-year DFS, 61% in locoregional RT and 37% in local RT, in the subgroup of patients with four or more positive lymph nodes. In a Cox regression model, higher T-stage, four or more positive lymph nodes, and LVI remained significant. For DFS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), the absence of estrogen receptors and the omission of regional RT were also significant.",

The present study was undertaken to determine whether toe-walking, which often occurs in conjunction with stiff-legged gait, in and of itself, might explain some of the reduced knee flexion in swing. An analysis was performed of three-dimensional kinematic data collected from able-bodied subjects while walking on their toes vs. normal heel-toe walking. Peak knee flexion was reduced significantly compared with normal heel-toe walking (42.2+/-8.9 degrees toe-walking vs. 59.2+/-5.7 degrees heel-toe walking; P<0.00001).",

However, urgent echocardiography may be unavailable, and surgery may therefore be delayed in some cases. We wished to determine if routine echocardiography is necessary for neonates with these diagnoses, or if appropriate patients could be selected. Retrospective review of all infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with EA, omphalocele, or ARM for 5 years (2003-2008). Clinically relevant findings in the cardiovascular examination (murmur, tachycardia, abnormal 4 limb blood pressure, cyanosis, shock), abnormalities in respiratory examination (intubation, tachypnea, desaturations), or abnormal chest x-ray (cardiomegaly, abnormal pulmonary vasculature) were documented. Cardiac defects were categorized according to their clinical impact as major or minor to differentiate those disorders which may influence timing of surgical intervention.

A knot tying technique was defined based on three criteria, i.e., both thread ends are crossed at the beginning at least two throws tied pulling at the same free end of the thread (standing part) and at least one knot tied changing the standing part. The knot tying techniques of 192 randomly chosen German surgeons practicing in 102 different hospitals were compared against this standard. Besides the status of the participating surgeons, the type of hospital in which they were currently working was recorded. Of the 192 participants, 69 were consultants, 56 fellows, and 67 residents. Forty-three surgeons (22.4%) worked in primary care centers (PCC), 81 (42.2%) in secondary care centers (SCC), and 68 (35.4%) in tertiary care centers (TCC). 62.5% crossed both thread ends at the beginning, 75.5% performed at least two identical throws keeping the same standing part, and 45.3% changed the standing part.

Using the triple-negative (TN) breast cancer cell lines, BT20, MDA-MB-231 and the non-TN cell line MDA-MB-453, knockdown of ADAM10 expression significantly decreased in vitro migration (P<0.01; for each cell line). Similarly, treatment with the ADAM10-selective inhibitor GI254023X reduced migration in the three cell lines (for BT20, P<0.001; for MDA-MB-231, P=0.005; for MDA-MB-453, P=0.023). In contrast, neither knockdown of ADAM10 nor treatment with the ADAM10-selective inhibitor GI254023X significantly affected cell numbers. Using extracts of primary breast cancers, higher levels of ADAM10 were found more frequently in high-grade vs low-grade tumours (P<0.001) and in oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative compared with ER-positive tumours (P=0.005). Analysis of pooled publicly available data sets found that high levels of ADAM10 mRNA were associated with adverse outcome in patients with the basal subtype of breast cancer.",

Sixty healthy volunteers and 69 patients requiring an acute chest x-ray in a cardiac care unit were included. The gas exchange parameters were estimated by analyzing standard bedside respiratory and circulatory measurements obtained during short-term exposure to different levels of inspired oxygen. Nine patients were classified as having pulmonary congestion using a reference diagnosis and were followed during 30 days of anticongestive therapy. Diagnostic and monitoring properties were compared with chest x-ray, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), spirometry values, arterial oxygen tension, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and venous admixture. The 95% reference intervals for healthy subjects were narrow (ie, fA2 [0.75 to 0.90], DeltaPO(2) [0.0 kPa to 0.5 kPa]and pulmonary shunt [0.0% to 8.2%]). Reproducibility was relatively good with small within subject coefficients of variation (ie, fA2 [0.05], DeltaPO(2) [0.4 kPa] and pulmonary shunt [2.0%]). fA2, DeltaPO(2) and NT-proBNP had significantly better diagnostic properties, with high sensitivities (100%) but low specificities (30% to 40%).

Between January of 1993 and January of 2004, 2469 patients with mitral valve disease underwent 2570 reoperations (1508 replacements, 1062 repairs). The approach was median sternotomy in 2444 patients, right thoracotomy in 80 patients, and other in 46 patients. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with median sternotomy versus right thoracotomy, mitral valve repair versus replacement, hospital death, and stroke. Factors favoring median sternotomy (P<.03) included coronary artery bypass grafting (30% vs 2%), aortic valve replacement (39% vs 2%), tricuspid valve repair (27% vs 13%), fewer previous cardiac operations, more recent reoperation, and no prior left internal thoracic artery graft. These factors were used to construct a propensity score for risk-adjusting outcomes. Hospital mortality was 6.7% (163/2444) for the median sternotomy approach and 6.3% (5/80) for the thoracotomy approach (P = .9). Risk factors (P<.04) included earlier surgery date, higher New York Heart Association class, emergency operation, multiple reoperations, and mitral valve replacement. Stroke occurred in 66 patients (2.7%) who underwent a median sternotomy and in 6 patients (7.5%) who underwent a thoracotomy (P = .006).

It is yet unknown what is the best time to start inhaled corticosteroid therapy and especially whether delayed introduction is harmful. PHASE 1: In a previous study in patients with asthma and COPD, we found that 2.5 years of treatment with a beta 2-agonist plus inhaled corticosteroid (BA + CS) was more effective in improving the FEV1 and the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PC20) than treatment with a beta 2-agonist plus anticholinergic (BA + AC) or placebo (BA + PL). PHASE 2: We extended this study with 6 months to investigate whether delayed introduction of inhaled CS therapy (800 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate) in the groups previously not treated with inhaled CS (BA +/- AC) could also improve FEV1 and PC20 to the same degree. A distinction was made between patients with predominantly asthma (high baseline reversibility, delta FEV1>or = 9% of predicted), and predominantly COPD (low baseline reversibility, delta FEV1<9% of predicted). Improvement of FEV1 percent predicted by inhaled CS was comparable both in the asthmatics between phase 1 (13.8% predicted) and phase 2 (8.5% predicted; p = 0.31) as well as in the patients with COPD (2.5% and 1.5% predicted, respectively).

Classifying grand multiparous women as a high-risk group without clear evidence of a consistent association with adverse outcomes can lead to socioeconomic burdens to the mother, family and health systems. We compared the maternal and perinatal complications among grand multiparous and other multiparous women in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was undertaken at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). A standard questionnaire enquired the following variables: demographic characteristics, antenatal profile and detected obstetric risk factors as well as maternal and neonatal risk factors. Predictors of adverse outcomes in relation to grand multiparous women were assessed at p\u2009=\u20090.05. Grand multiparas had twice the likelihood of malpresentation and a threefold higher prevalence of meconium-stained liquor and placenta previa compared with lower-parity women even when adjusted for age. Neonates delivered by grand multiparous women (12.1%) were at three-time greater risk of a low Apgar score compared with lower-parity women (5.4%) (odds ratio (OR), 2.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-5.0). Grand multiparity and low birth weight were independently associated with a low Apgar score (OR, 2.4; 95%, CI 1.4-4.2 for GM; OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.3-7.8) for low birth weight.",

This study was an audit of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels measured routinely in a sample of 53 inpatients in a private psychiatric clinic. These levels were compared with those of controls without psychiatric illness. The median levels of serum 25-OHD were 43.0 nmol L(-1) (range 20-102 nmol L(-1)) in the patient population, 46.0 nmol L(-1) (range 20-102 nmol L(-1)) in female patients (n =33) and 41.5 nmol L(-1) (range 22-97 nmol L(-1)) in male patients (n =20). The proportion of vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25-OHD<or =50 nmol L(-1)) in this patient population was 58%. Furthermore, 11% had moderate deficiency (serum 25-OHD<or =25 nmol L(-1)). There was a 29% difference between mean levels in the patient population and control sample (geometric mean age- and season-adjusted levels: 46.4 nmol L(-1) (95% confidence interval (CI) =38.6-54.9 nmol L(-1)) vs 65.3 nmol L(-1) (95%CI =63.2-67.4 nmol L(-1)), p<0.001).",

When screening through registry reports from different countries, it appears that revision is defined quite differently.QUESTIONS/ The purposes of this study were to compare the definitions of revision among registry reports and to apply common clinical scenarios to these definitions. We downloaded or requested reports of all available national joint registries. Of the 23 registries we identified, 13 had published reports that were available in English and were beyond the pilot phase. We searched these registries' reports for the definitions of the endpoint, mostly revision. We then applied the following scenarios to the definition of revision and analyzed if those scenarios were regarded as a revision: (A) wound revision without any addition or removal of implant components (such as hematoma evacuation); (B) exchange of head and/or liner (like for infection); (C) isolated secondary patella resurfacing; and (D) secondary patella resurfacing with a routine liner exchange. All registries looked separately at the characteristic of primary implantation without a revision and 11 of 13 registers reported on the characteristics of revisions. Regarding the definition of revision, there were considerable differences across the reports. In 11 of 13 reports, the primary outcome was revision of the implant. In one registry the primary endpoint was \"reintervention/revision\" while another registry reported separately on \"failure\" and \"reoperations\". In three registries, the definition of the outcome was not provided, however in one report a results list gave an indication for the definition of the outcome. Wound revision without any addition or removal of implant components (scenario A) was considered a revision in three of nine reports that provided a clear definition on this question, whereas two others did not provide enough information to allow this determination. Exchange of the head and/or liner (like for infection; scenario B) was considered a revision in 11 of 11; isolated secondary patella resurfacing (scenario C) in six of eight; and secondary patella resurfacing with routine liner exchange (scenario D) was considered a revision in nine of nine reports.",
        "Behavior": "Question: Is a Revision a Revision?",
        "answer": "Revision, which is the most common main endpoint used by arthroplasty registries, is not universally defined. This implies that some reoperations that are considered a revision in one registry are not considered a revision in another registry. Therefore, comparisons of implant performance using data from different registries have to be performed with caution. We suggest that registries work to harmonize their definitions of revision to help facilitate comparisons of results across the world's arthroplasty registries."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between surgical delay for proximal humeral fracture and inpatient adverse events, in-hospital death, prolonged postoperative stay, and nonroutine discharge. Of the more than 70,000 patients with an operatively treated proximal humeral fracture identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2008 and 2011, 87% underwent surgery within 2\u00a0days of admission and 13% underwent surgery 3 days or more after admission. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of surgical delay on inpatient outcomes and to identify risk factors associated with late surgery. Surgery 3\u00a0days or more after admission for fracture of the proximal humerus had no influence on in-hospital death but was independently associated with inpatient adverse events (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-2.2), prolonged postoperative stay (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.7-1.9), and increased nonroutine discharge (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.6-2.9).

This study was institutional review board-approved and participants gave written informed consent. In 34 MS patients and 17 age-matched control participants, 7-T quantitative T2* maps, 3-T T1-weighted anatomic images for cortical surface reconstruction, and 3-T diffusion tensor images (DTI) were obtained. Cortical quantitative T2* maps were sampled at 25%, 50%, 75% depth from pial surface. Tracts of interest were reconstructed by using probabilistic tractography. The relationship between DTI metrics voxelwise of the tracts and cortical integrity in the projection cortex was tested by using multilinear regression models. In MS, DTI abnormal findings along tracts correlated with quantitative T2* changes (suggestive of iron and myelin loss) at each depth of the cortical projection area (P<.01, corrected). This association, however, was not spatially specific because abnormal findings in WM tracts also related to cortical pathologic changes outside of the projection cortex of the tract (P<.001). Expanded Disability Status Scale pyramidal score was predicted by axial diffusivity along the corticospinal tract (\u03b2 = 4.6 \u00d7 10(3); P<.001), Symbol Digit Modalities Test score by radial diffusivity along the cingulum (\u03b2 = -4.3 \u00d7 10(4); P<.01), and T2* in the cingulum cortical projection at 25% depth (\u03b2 = -1.7; P<.05).",

This study sought to determine whether atrial fibrillation is merely a marker for high-risk patients or an independent risk factor for time-related mortality. From 1972 to 2000, 46,984 patients underwent primary isolated coronary artery bypass grafting; 451 (0.96% prevalence) had electrocardiogram-documented preoperative atrial fibrillation (n = 411) or flutter (n = 40). Characteristics of patients with and without atrial fibrillation were contrasted by multivariable logistic regression to form a propensity score. With this, comparable groups with and without atrial fibrillation were formed by pairwise propensity-matching to assess survival. Patients with preoperative atrial fibrillation were older (67 +/- 9.0 versus 59 +/- 9.8 years, p<0.0001), had more left ventricular dysfunction (66% versus 52%, p<0.0001) and hypertension (73% versus 59%, p<0.0001), but less severe angina (39% moderate or severe versus 49%, p<0.0001). Many of these factors are themselves predictors of increased time-related mortality. In propensity-matched patients, survival at 30 days and at 5 and 10 years for patients with versus without atrial fibrillation was 97% versus 99%, 68% versus 85%, and 42% versus 66%, respectively, a survival difference at 10 years of 24%.

(3) To determine the chances of being satisfied with the received care in absence of treatment success. There is a lack of evidence on determinants of treatment satisfaction in patients with CLBP, specifically the role of patient's expectation of disability reduction after treatment. Treatment expectation was measured with questions inspired by the Pain Disability Index (PDI) at baseline. Treatment success was considered if disability at the end of therapy was lower than, or equal to pretreatment expectation. An exploratory factor analysis was performed on the new questionnaire. Binary logistic regression models were used to analyze how much variance of satisfaction with care was explained by treatment success, pain disability at baseline, sex, age, duration of complaints, and pain intensity. The odds ratio of being satisfied when treatment was successful was calculated. Six hundred nine patients were included. The factor structure of the PDI-expectancy had optimal fit with a one factor structure. There were low correlations between the expected and baseline disability, pain intensity, and duration of pain. Correlation between treatment success and satisfaction with care was low (\u03c7\u200a=\u200a0.13; P\u200a<\u200a0.01). Treatment success had a low contribution to satisfaction with care.

Patients with erectile dysfunction were excluded from the study. The data was assessed using the abridged, 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Questions were also asked about libido, penile sensitivity, premature ejaculation, pain during intercourse and appearance before and after circumcision. IIEF-5 data was analysed using two-tailed paired t test to compare pre-operative and post-operative score changes across the study group. For the rest of the questions, data was analysed using 'Sign Test', calculating two-sided p values and 95% confidence intervals. Fifty-nine percent of patients (88/150) responded. The total mean IIEF-5 score was 22.41 +/- 0.94 and 21.13 +/- 3.17 before and after circumcision, respectively (p = 0.4). Seventy-four percent of patients had no change in their libido levels, 69% noticed less pain during intercourse (p<0.05), and 44% of the patients (p = 0.04) and 38% of the partners (p = 0.02) thought the penis appearance improved after circumcision. Penile sensation improved after circumcision in 38% (p = 0.01) but got worse in 18%, with the remainder having no change. Overall satisfaction was 61%.",
        "Behavior": "Question: Penile sensitivity and sexual satisfaction after circumcision: are we informing men correctly?",
        "answer": "Penile sensitivity had variable outcomes after circumcision. The poor outcome of circumcision considered by overall satisfaction rates suggests that when we circumcise men, these outcome data should be discussed during the informed consent process."

This HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval. All patients gave written informed consent. Four protocols were compared. Standard protocol involved 125 mL of iopamidol injected at 4 mL/sec. Total body weight (TBW) protocol involved 0.7 g iodine per kilogram of TBW. Calculated LBW and measured LBW protocols involved 0.86 g of iodine per kilogram and 0.92 g of iodine per kilogram calculated or measured LBW for men and women, respectively. Injection rate used for the three experimental protocols was determined proportionally on the basis of the calculated volume of contrast material. Postcontrast attenuation measurements during portal venous phase were obtained in liver, portal vein, and aorta for each group and were summed for each patient. Patient-to-patient enhancement variability in same group was measured with Levene test. Two-tailed t test was used to compare the three experimental protocols with the standard protocol. Data analysis was performed in 101 patients (25 or 26 patients per group), including 56 men and 45 women (mean age, 53 years). Average summed attenuation values for standard, TBW, calculated LBW, and measured LBW protocols were 419 HU +/- 50 (standard deviation), 443 HU +/- 51, 433 HU +/- 50, and 426 HU +/- 33, respectively (P = not significant for all). Levene test results for summed attenuation data for standard, TBW, calculated LBW, and measured LBW protocols were 40 +/- 29, 38 +/- 33 (P = .83), 35 +/- 35 (P = .56), and 26 +/- 19 (P = .05), respectively.",

This observational comparative study consisted of 33 migraine (26 women and 7 men) patients referred from neurology clinics and 33 (22 women and 11 men) control subjects referred from ophthalmology outpatient clinics. The control subjects had neither systemic nor ocular disease nor any type of headache. All 66 patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination and diagnostic tests for dry eye, including tear break-up time, Schirmer test with topical anesthesia, lissamine green staining, and an ocular surface disease score. Patients with migraine were classified as migraine with an aura, migraine without an aura, and basilar migraine; a pain score from 1 to 4 was determined for each patient, based on the American Headache Society's Migraine Disability Assessment Test. Of the 33 patients who participated in the migraine group, 17 (51%) suffered from migraine with aura, 11 (33%) suffered from migraine without aura, and 5 (15%) suffered from basilar migraine. Significant differences in dry eye scores were found between the patients with migraine and the control subjects. In the migraine group, the mean tear break-up time was 7.75\u00b12.37 seconds, whereas in the control group it was 9.15\u00b11.93 seconds.

Between October 2010 and March 2011, a sample of 94 low-income, parenting adolescents and young adults recruited at clinics in Connecticut completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview about their use of media technologies, communication with friends about sexual health and willingness to use media technologies for such communication. Descriptive statistics were calculated; characteristics of those willing and those unwilling to communicate were compared in chi-square, t and Mann-Whitney tests. Ninety-three percent of participants had mobile phones; 71% used Facebook regularly. Participants discussed sexual health more often with close friends than with casual friends, and preferred to have such conversations in person (71% with close friends and 68% with casual friends), over the phone (52% and 45%) or via text message (30% and 28%), rather than through social networking sites (0-9% and 2-7%).

This is an important consideration when using manipulative therapy techniques. The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of atherosclerosis and to calculate the relative associated decrease in blood flow in the third and fourth parts of the vertebral artery, in a sample of the adult population. A laboratory-based experimental investigation was used to study 362 vertebral arteries from embalmed adult cadavers that were routinely processed for light microscopic study. The incidence of each grade of atherosclerosis in the vessels was recorded. Atherosclerosis was classified as grades 0-5, where Grade 0 represented no atherosclerosis and Grade 5 a fully developed plaque occluding more than 75% of the vessel lumen. From mean measurements of 188 of these arteries, the estimated decrease in luminal cross-sectional area and the relative decrease in blood flow in the atherosclerotic vessels were calculated. The highest incidence of atherosclerosis found was Grade 3 (third part of the vertebral artery (VA3): 42.0%; fourth part of the vertebral artery (VA4): 35.2%). An estimated decrease in artery luminal cross-sectional area to 6.2% of normal in Grade 5 atherosclerosis was found. Because blood flow is proportional to the fourth power of the vessel radius, relative decreases in blood flow in grades 1-5 atherosclerosis from 100% to 0% (with critical closing pressure in vessels), respectively, are likely to occur.",

These postural adjustments occur prior to movement and prevent unwanted perturbation of the trunk. In low back pain, postural adjustments of the trunk muscles are altered such that the deep trunk muscles are consistently delayed and the superficial trunk muscles are sometimes augmented. This alteration of postural adjustments may reflect disruption of normal postural control imparted by reduced central nervous system resources available during pain, so-called \"pain interference,\" or reflect adoption of an alternate postural adjustment strategy. We aimed to clarify this by recording electromyographic activity of the upper (obliquus externus) and lower (transversus abdominis/obliquus internus) abdominal muscles during voluntary arm movements that were coupled with painful cutaneous stimulation at the low back. If the effect of pain on postural adjustments is caused by pain interference, it should be greatest at the onset of the stimulus, should habituate with repeated exposure, and be absent immediately when the threat of pain is removed. Sixteen patients performed 30 forward movements of the right arm in response to a visual cue (control). Seventy trials were then conducted in which arm movement was coupled with pain (\"pain trials\") and then a further 70 trials were conducted without the pain stimulus (\"no pain trials\"). There was a gradual and increasing delay of transversus abdominis/obliquus internus electromyograph and augmentation of obliquus externus during the pain trials, both of which gradually returned to control values during the no pain trials.",

This study aims to assess the efficacy of corticosteroids treatment for H1N1 infection. Systematic review and meta-analysis were used to estimate the efficacy of corticosteroids for the prevention of mortality in H1N1 infection. Databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials and so on, and bibliographies of retrieved articles, from April 2009 to October 2014. We included both cohort studies and case-control studies reported in English or Chinese that compared treatment effects between corticosteroids and non-corticosteroids therapy in inpatients with H1N1 virus infection. Cohort studies employed mortality as outcome, and case-control studies employed deaths as cases and survivors as controls; both were assessed in this meta-analysis. In total twenty-three eligible studies were included. Both cohort studies (nine studies, n\u2009=\u20091,405) and case-control studies (14 studies, n\u2009=\u20094,700) showed a similar trend toward increased mortality (cohort studies relative risk was 1.85 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46 to 2.33; case-control studies odds ratio was 4.22 with 95% CI 3.10 to 5.76). The results from both subgroup analyses and sensitive analyses were consistent with each other, showing that steroid treatment is associated with mortality.

These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis. The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease. We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease (n = 281), coronary artery disease (n = 175), and stroke (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline. Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend<0.01) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements.

Participants included 37 patients aged 21-66 years with prior nonstandardized bitewing radiographs scheduled to receive bitewing radiographs as part of their next routine dental care visit. Standardized bitewing radiographs were taken with a Rinn film holder to position the film in the mouth and align the X-rays so that they were at 90 degrees to the film. Before taking the radiograph the bite was registered in centric relation using a polyether impression material. One registered dental hygienist took and processed all the standardized radiographs. One dentist read all radiographs using a viewing box, magnifying lens, and periodontal probe with William's markings. Radiographic bone loss was measured to the closest millimeter at mesial and distal sites of the posterior teeth excluding third molars. The examining dentist was blinded to the participant's name, age, gender, or if the radiograph was standardized or nonstandardized. Mean bone loss (+/- SD) was similar in the standardized and nonstandardized groups (1.60 +/- 0.72 mm versus 1.64 +/- 0.85 mm), and the correlation was high (r = 0.95). Periodontitis was defined as present if the participant had at least one site with 3, 4 and 5 mm bone loss.

Breast density was evaluated for all patients on a high-risk screening study who were diagnosed with breast cancer between November 1997 and July 2006. Density was measured in two ways: qualitatively using the four categories characterized by the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System and quantitatively using a computer-aided technique and classified as (a)<or=10%, (b) 11% to 25%, (c) 26% to 50%, and (d)>50% density.

We set out to determine the level of agreement between EMP impression and disposition as determined by PPs. This was a prospective observational study in an urban tertiary teaching hospital emergency department. We collected data from February to April 2011. We used a convenience sample of patient encounters evaluated by EMPs and subsequent referral for psychiatric evaluation. We asked EMPs whether they thought the patients would be admitted or discharged following psychiatric evaluation, and if discharged, whether to outpatient psychiatric follow-up or to no follow-up. EMPs were asked to base their opinion upon their general impression following their brief medical evaluation. They were not given guidelines on which to base their decision. The EMPs were blind to PP decisions. The \u03ba-statistic was used to calculate agreement between the EMP's impression and disposition decision by the PP. We excluded patients who were acutely intoxicated, in police custody, or lived in an extended care facility. We included 156 patient encounters over the study period and had complete data for 152 encounters. Of these, 86 (55%) were admitted, 46 (30%) were discharged with no specific psychiatric follow-up, and 20 (13%) were discharged with a follow-up plan. EMPs predicted the exact disposition in 77/152 (51%) cases (\u03ba=0.264, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.333). Agreement was higher for admitted patients, with EMPs predicting inpatient admission for 57/86 (66%) of these patients.

A total of 69 consecutive patients with SSc (mean (SD) age 56 (13) years, 56 women) were prospectively studied with standard echocardiography and TDE measurements of longitudinal mitral and tricuspid annular velocities. Plasma NT-proBNP was measured in all patients. Overall, 18 patients had manifestations of cardiac involvement, of whom 7 had depressed left ventricular and 8 depressed right ventricular myocardial contractility, and 8 had elevated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure. Patients with reduced contractility had increased mean (SD) NT-proBNP (704 (878) pg/ml versus 118 (112) pg/ml in patients with normal myocardial contractility, p<0.001).

Child Abuse Potential scores and data on demographics, pregnancy desire, history of maltreatment, psychological functioning, and perceived social support were obtained by self-report and semi-structured interview. The sample consisted of 50 poor single adolescents recruited from prenatal clinics during the second half of the pregnancy. The relationships among the variables were assessed using Pearson product-moment correlation and multiple regression strategies. Higher Child Abuse Potential scores were associated with higher maternal psychological distress, maternal history of psychiatric diagnosis, and lack of perceived support by the father of the baby. Older pregnant teenagers were more likely to report childhood history of maltreatment, higher psychological distress, and perceived and expected less support by the maternal mother. Expectant mothers who were raised by a single parent were more likely to have a history of childhood maltreatment, less likely to live with the father of the baby during their pregnancy and to expect less support from him.",
        "Behavior": "Question: Poor adolescent expectant mothers: can we assess their potential for child abuse?",
        "answer": "Child Abuse Potential scores, obtained during pregnancy in a sample of poor single adolescents provide a marker of maternal prenatal functioning and perceived social support. Further studies are warranted to validate prenatal use of the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI), which may help identify populations at particularly high risk for child abuse during pregnancy and inform strategies for early preventive interventions. Adolescent education on family planning, child rearing, and social support programs should address the importance of the fathers' role."

The present study was aimed to determine the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and other PFCs in drinking water (tap and bottled) and river water samples from Tarragona Province (Catalonia, Spain). Municipal drinking (tap) water samples were collected from the four most populated towns in the Tarragona Province, whereas samples of bottled waters were purchased from supermarkets. River water samples were collected from the Ebro (two samples), Cortiella, and Francol\u00ed Rivers. After pretreatment, PFC analyses were performed by HPLC-MS. Quantification was done using the internal standard method, with recoveries between 68% and 118%. In tap water, PFOS and PFOA levels ranged between 0.39 and 0.87 ng/L (0.78 and 1.74 pmol/L) and between 0.32 and 6.28 ng/L (0.77 and 15.2 pmol/L), respectively. PFHpA, PFHxS, and PFNA were also other detected PFCs. PFC levels were notably lower in bottled water, where PFOS could not be detected in any sample. Moreover, PFHpA, PFHxS, PFOA, PFNA, PFOS, PFOSA, and PFDA could be detected in the river water samples. PFOS and PFOA concentrations were between<0.24 and 5.88 ng/L (<0.48 and 11.8 pmol/L) and between<0.22 and 24.9 ng/L (<0.53 and 60.1 pmol/L), respectively. Assuming a human water consumption of 2 L per day, the daily intake of PFOS and PFOA by the population of the area under evaluation was calculated (0.78-1.74 and 12.6 ng, respectively). It was found that drinking water might be a source of exposure to PFCs as important as the dietary intake of these pollutants.",

This noninvasive technique, which does not add any cost to the procedure, offers the advantage of avoiding 'arousals' during sleep measurement as occurs with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). We aim to confirm the usefulness of PTT for the detection of hypertension, and to study the correlation between both measurements. Prospective observational study in a multidisciplinary sleep unit. We recruited 30consecutive patients attending a sleep clinic and ran a baseline polysomnography followed by an ABPM the following day. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) by PTT were calculated and compared with ABMP results. In accordance with international guidelines, patients with mean nocturnal ABMP \u2265 120/70 mmHg were diagnosed as having arterial hypertension. Mean age of 60years; 66% male, 80% suffered from sleep apnoea (OSAS). Taking the ABPM as the reference technique, we found that the diagnostic sensitivity of PTT is 85% with a specificity of 88% in the case of SBP, with a positive predictive value of 85% and negative predictive value of 88%. By studying the relationship between mean SBP measured by ABPM and PTT, we found a linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.88, showing a distribution of all subjects with a difference of between \u00b115mmHg between tests.

We address the question if model selection matters topologically, that is, if conducting ML inferences under the optimal, instead of a standard General Time Reversible model, yields different tree topologies. We also assess, to which degree models selected and trees inferred under the three standard criteria (AIC, AICc, BIC) differ. Finally, we assess if the definition of the sample size (#sites versus #sites \u00d7 #taxa) yields different models and, as a consequence, different tree topologies. We find that, all three factors (by order of impact: nucleotide model selection, information criterion used, sample size definition) can yield topologically substantially different final tree topologies (topological difference exceeding 10 %) for approximately 5 % of the tree inferences conducted on the 39 empirical datasets used in our study.",

EP shows better chemical and physical properties, is said to be less toxic but is five times more expensive than VP16. Some criteria were defined for the use of each form in the Paediatric Oncohaematology Department in Hopital Sud in Rennes. As some particular cutaneous side effects were observed during treatment with etoposide-based course in this department, a retrospective study was initiated. The aims of this work were to determine the side effects (especially cutaneous toxicity), whether the pharmaceutical formulation of etoposide had any influence on the toxicity of the drug, and whether the observed side effects resulted from etoposide alone or from particular antineoplastic drug associations. Five types of etoposide-containing protocols were chosen: NB 97 and NB 99 (neuroblastoma), FRALLE 93 (acute lymphoid leukaemia), LAME 91 (acute myeloid leukaemia), OS 94 (osteosarcoma), Ewing 97 and Euro-Ewing 99 (Ewing sarcoma). The medical files of 36 children (88 EP courses, 25 VP16 courses) included in these protocols were analysed on the basis that if a child showed a side effect during a course, the child had to have recovered from that side effect before the beginning of the next course. Apart from classical side effects (haematological and digestive toxicities etc.), two particular cutaneous side effects were observed: (1) palmar-plantar eruptions and nail inflammations, and (2) irritation of the anal area and anal fissures.

We examined the possible role of the cardiac capsaicin-sensitive sensory innervation in pacing-induced preconditioning, as well as in the cardiac NO and CGRP content. Wistar rats were treated subcutaneously with capsaicin or its solvent in the sequence of 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg increasing single daily doses for 3 days to deplete neurotransmitters of the sensory innervation. Isolated hearts from both groups were then subjected to either preconditioning induced by three consecutive periods of pacing at 600 beats per minute for 5 min with 5 min interpacing periods, or time-matched non-preconditioning perfusion, followed by a 10-min coronary occlusion. NO content of left ventricular tissue samples was assayed by electron-spin resonance, and CGRP release was determined by radioimmunoassay. CGRP immunohistochemistry was also performed. In the non-preconditioned, solvent-treated group, coronary occlusion decreased cardiac output (CO) from 68.1 to 32.1 mL/min, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) from 0.58 to 1.90 kPa, and resulted in 200 mU/min/g LDH release. Preconditioning significantly increased ischaemic CO to 42.9 mL/min (P<0.05), decreased ischaemic LVEDP to 1.26 kPa (P<0.05) and decreased LDH release to 47 mU/min/g (P<0.05) in the solvent-treated group. Preconditioning did not confer protection in the capsaicin-pretreated group (ischaemic CO: 35.6 mL/min; 1.76 kPa; LDH 156 mU/min/g).

During follow-up, when nodules grow, re-aspiration or surgical resection for a histologic diagnosis is recommended. However, there is little evidence regarding the malignancy risk associated with nodule growth. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 542 patients with FNAC-diagnosed adenomatous nodules (ANs) who underwent surgery in 2011-2012 at Kuma Hospital. Among them, 196 patients had surgical resection because of nodule volume growth (median, 1.94 times; range, 1.21-27.60) during the observation period (mean, 45.9 months). Excluding nodule growth, the remaining 346 patients underwent surgery for various reasons including the large size of nodules or the appearance of undefined ultrasound features suspicious for malignancy during follow-up. For comparison, we reviewed 409 patients with FNAC-diagnosed follicular neoplasms (FNs) operated on in 2011-2013. Most (n=327) underwent surgery shortly after the FNAC diagnosis, while 82 patients were observed for a period of time and had a late operation due to nodule volume growth (median, 2.70 times; range, 1.27-15.82). The histologic diagnoses of the 196 growing FNAC-diagnosed ANs were 158 ANs, 32 follicular adenomas (FAs), 4 follicular tumors of uncertain malignant potential (FT-UMP; 2%), and 2 malignancies (1%). The 346 patients who underwent surgery for reasons other than nodular growth had 16 FT-UMP (4.6%) and 16 malignancies (4.6%).

A multilevel approach was used to investigate the association among individual socioeconomic variables, as well as the type of school, and the outcome. When all significant variables in the univariate analysis were used in the multiple model, only mother's schooling and household income (individual socioeconomic variables) presented significant associations with presence of dental caries, and the type of school was not significantly associated. However, when the type of school was used alone, children of public school presented significantly higher prevalence of dental caries than those enrolled in private schools.",

There are no bibliographic reports about it in younger myocardial infarction survivors. The aim of the study was to evaluate sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of symptoms limited maximal exercise testing for multivessel disease diagnosis in young patients after myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction survivors until the age of 40 performed symptoms limited maximal exercise testing and had a coronary arteriography before hospital discharge. A total of 100 consecutive patients were included, although in only 83 of them exercise tests and coronariographic studies were done. In this group, multivessel disease was confirmed in 27 patients (15 with positive tests and 12 with normal exercise testing). In the remaining 56 young adults without multivessel involvement, positive tests were only observed in 15 patients and normal tests in 45. Thus, a sensitivity of 56%, specificity of 73%, positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 77% were found. When patients showed high risk exercise test criteria, the exercise test positive predictive value increased to 80%.",

This belief has persisted for two decades despite the absence of rigorous prospective evaluation. To address this issue, the authors studied the cardiovascular effects of doxepin in 32 depressed patients with preexisting left ventricular impairment, ventricular arrhythmias, and/or conduction disease. Doxepin (1) did not have a robust effect on heart rate, (2) did not adversely affect left ventricular function, (3) did have a significant antiarrhythmic effect, (4) slowed cardiac conduction, and (5) caused a significant increase in orthostatic hypotension. Five (16%) of the 32 patients dropped out due to cardiovascular side effects. The overall dropout rate was 41%.",

The main problem is common to all countries and concerns the efforts to meet elderly persons' needs on an individual level while still maintaining society's responsibility for distributing justice. The aim of this study is to elaborate an instrument for measuring the quality of individual care and staff's working time in order to allocate public resources fairly. The present study gives an account of a new classification system named TiC (Time in Care), indicating how it can be used most effectively and also investigating the validity and reliability of the system. All recipients in 13 sheltered homes for elderly care (n = 505) in a Swedish municipality were surveyed regarding the care they needed, in dimensions of General Care, Medical Care, Cognitive Dysfunction and Rehabilitation, and the time required. Construct validity was assessed by means of factor analysis. The inter-rater agreement of two raters concerning 79 recipients was measured using weighted Kappa. The stability of the instrument and its sensitivity to change were investigated through test-retest reliability measurements, conducted once a month during a six-month period. The content validity of the instrument was also assessed. Factor analysis resulted in a reduction of the number of items from 25 to 16 in three dimensions: General Care, Medical Care and Cognitive Dysfunction. The Kappa analysis showed satisfactory to excellent inter-rater agreement. The care need scores were basically stable but showed sensitivity to change in health status.",

Our aim was to update our understanding on how the age of the patient at the time of surgery influences functional outcome and quality of life after IPAA. From January 1, 1981, to December 31, 2000, two thousand two patients who underwent IPAA were studied. Patients were grouped by age at operation: 45 years or younger (n = 1688), between 46 and 55 years (n = 249), and older than 55 years (n = 65). Mean age was 33.5 years. Postoperative complications, function, and quality of life were assessed with a questionnaire administered annually. Follow-up for patients older than 55 years was a mean +/- SD of 8.1 +/- 4.8 years. Overall, follow-up was a mean of 10.1 +/- 5.7 years. The pouch failure rate for patients older than 55 years was 1.6% at 10 years. No statistically significant difference in pouch failure between age groups was observed. Overall, frequent daytime and nighttime incontinence, respectively, occurred in 5.6% and 13.3% of the patients at 10 years. Incontinence was more common in older patients (P = .002 at 3 years).

However, conflicting conclusions have been drawn and this topic needs further investigation. A total of 170 patients had radical prostatectomy for T1-T2 prostate carcinoma. Patients' mean age (+/- standard deviation [SD]) was 66.05 +/- 6.12 years and mean prostate specific antigen (PSA) level (+/- SD) was 22.5 +/- 21.4 ng/mL (Yang Proscheck). Of the patients, 110 underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy with removal of 6 cores, from whom we had the percentage of biopsy, material invaded by cancer, the Gleason score, and the preoperative PSA. These parameters were compared with the pathologic features of the surgical specimen (capsule penetration, surgical margins, and Gleason score) and biologic progression (defined as persistent/recurrent postoperative PSA>0.1 ng/mL). The most valid threshold of biopsy material invaded by cancer for predicting surgical margins and capsule status, as well as biologic progression, was 10%. When<10% of biopsy material was invaded by cancer, positive surgical margins (SM+) were present in 30.3%, capsular penetration (pT3, pathologic extracapsular involvement) in 27.3%, and biologic progression (P+) in 21.7%. The Gleason score did not improve this prognostic evaluation.

Despite the evidence on the effectiveness of a short feedback on screening or self-help material, most studies performed so far have required considerable time from staff and thus been difficult to implement in the real world. The present study evaluates the effect of the screening and whether simple written advice has any additional effect on risky drinking. An alcohol screening routine was implemented among injury patients in a Swedish emergency care department. Over 12 months, two cohorts were invited to answer an alcohol screening questionnaire in the waiting room. In the first 6 months, 771 patients were screened without any written advice (cohort A) and in the following 6 months, 563 were screened and in addition received simple written advice about sensible drinking (cohort B). None of the patients received one-to-one feedback. Six months after the screening, a follow-up interview by telephone explored the changes in drinking. In cohort A 182 (24%) of the patients were defined as risky drinkers and in cohort B 125 (22%). Reached at follow-up after 6 months were 81 (44%) risky and 278 (47%) non-risky drinkers in cohort A, and 40 (32%) risky and 220 (50%) non-risky drinkers in cohort B. The number of patients with heavy episodic drinking decreased significantly in cohort A from 76 (94% of the risky drinkers) to 49 (59%). In cohort B a similar change was seen from 37 (92%) to 27 (68%). Only in cohort B, was a significant increase in readiness to change drinking habits seen [from 3 (8%) to 9 (23%)]. The reduction in heavy episodic drinking was comparable with previous reports from more extensive interventions.

A total of 1160 NHS-funded patients undergoing hip replacement, knee replacement or varicose vein surgery. s) None.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): General health status (EQ-5D), disease-specific health status (Oxford hip score, Oxford knee score and Aberdeen varicose vein symptom severity score) and area deprivation score. Patients from more deprived areas reported worse EQ-5D scores. Differences in crude mean disease-specific health status scores between the least and most deprived fifths were small: hip score 3.5; knee score 6.8; varicose vein score 4.8. When risk adjusted the strength of the association fell by about half for hip (0.176-0.083) and knee (0.214-0.117) and one-third for varicose vein surgery (0.215-0.140), although the coefficients remained statistically significant (P<or = 0.01).",

        "answer": "Deprivation was associated with worse pre-operative general health status. However, given that the variation in pre-operative disease-specific health status by deprivation score was of small clinical significance and the limited power of the risk adjustment model, there is little evidence of socioeconomic inequity in access to three common elective surgical procedures."

        "ContextString": "Answer the question based on the following context: Open repair of juxta-renal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) sometimes involves the ligation and division of the left renal vein (LRV). Some surgeons advocate repair, but this is not common practice. The aim was to study the effect of LRV ligation on renal function. A retrospective audit of all open AAA repairs between February 2004 and September 2007 in our unit was completed. Pre- and postoperative renal function was assessed with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), using an established formula. Two hundred sixty-one open AAA repairs were performed in the study period. The LRV was ligated in 18.8%; mean age was 75.5 years, 35 were men, mean AAA diameter was 7.8 cm, there were 7 elective, 22 urgent, and 19 emergency AAA repairs. Renal function with LRV ligated was compared with the 212 patients without LRV ligation by independent samples t-testing. The baseline mean serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate in the LRV ligated group were 115.1 micromol/L and 60.6, respectively, which were similar to the LRV not ligated group (p>0.05). The renal function at postoperative day 1, day 7, and weeks 2-6 was similar in the two groups (p>0.05). The postoperative renal function on day 1 was significantly worse compared to baseline (p<0.05), but not at day 7 and weeks 2-6 (p>0.05).",

There has been some speculation regarding the relative merit of the components of this approach. The aim of this study was to compare (i) cognitive strategies; (ii) behavioural strategies; and (iii) combined cognitive-behavioural (CB) strategies on depressed mood among a sample of 70 individuals with mild ID. Staff from three participating agencies received training in how to screen individuals with mild ID for depressive symptoms and risk factors for depression. Depressive symptoms and negative automatic thoughts were assessed prior to and at the conclusion of the intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. The interventions were run in groups by the same therapist. A post-intervention reduction in depression scores was evident in participants of all three interventions, with no significant difference between groups. A significant reduction in negative automatic thoughts post-intervention was evident in the CB combination group and was maintained at follow-up. Examination of clinical effectiveness suggests some advantage of the CB combination in terms of improvement and highlights the possible short term impact of behavioural strategies in comparison with the longer-term potential of cognitive strategies.",

Furthermore, the relationship between the number of naevi and their density in an individual has not been explored. Thus, for example, it is unknown if larger people tend to have more naevi by virtue of having a larger skin area, or if the density of naevi is similar in people of different body sizes. In this study, we explored the relationship between the number and the density of naevi in a sample of adolescents. A sample survey of naevi in 472 grade 9 secondary school students (aged 14-15 years) was conducted in Tasmania, Australia during 1992, and a subset of these individuals was followed up in 1997. Counts of naevi of various sizes were taken on the arm, leg, and back. Naevus density was estimated by using an algorithm to estimate body surface area from the height and weight of an individual. More general relationships of the naevus counts to height and weight were also explored. Finally, we considered whether the relationship between naevus density and the anthropometric variables could be confounded by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The mean number of naevi was very similar in the two samples. Naevus density was slightly lower in the 1997 sample, mainly because of increasing body size in the cohort. The numbers of naevi were only weakly related to height and weight in males, and there was essentially no relationship in females. Regression analysis showed significant relationships of weight to the back naevus counts in males in 1992 and 1997, and to the arm naevus count in males in 1997; otherwise, none of the regression coefficients for height and weight were statistically significant. This picture did not change following adjustment for potentially confounding variables indicating time spent outdoors or in the sun. Furthermore, there was no evidence that time spent in the sun was related to the body mass index.",
        "Behavior": "Question: Do larger people have more naevi?",
        "answer": "It appears that the number and density of naevi in an individual are unrelated. Accordingly, with the present state of knowledge concerning the risk of melanoma, both the number and density of naevi should be considered as equally valid in future studies as markers of the risk of melanoma, and in studies on the natural history of naevi. If the disease mechanism is systemic, and not related to particular naevi, naevus density might form the better marker of risk. However, if the disease mechanism is related to effects on particular naevi, then the risk would vary in proportion to the number of naevi."

TOMPOOL is a software that processes data acquired with Tomographic Equilibrium Radionuclide Ventriculography. In this report, TOMPOOL's diagnostic accuracy and inter-observer reproducibility were assessed in a cohort of patients with various etiologies of ventricular dysfunction. End-diastolic volume (EDV), ejection fraction (EF), and cardiac output (CO) were calculated for the right ventricle (RV) and the left ventricle (LV) using TOMPOOL in 99 consecutive patients. Thirty-five patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) considered as the reference-standard to measure EDV and EF; the Spearman's rho correlation coefficients were r = 0.73/0.80 and 0.67/0.73 for right/left EF and EDV, respectively. Twenty-one patients had thermodilution measurements of right CO (reference-standard), the correlation was r = 0.57.

Distal filter devices may provide cerebral protection by capturing clinically significant debris. However, they increase procedural time and expense and have their own set of complications. The current study was undertaken to identify the clinical factors predictive for the presence or absence of visible debris captured by distal filter devices during CAS. Patients undergoing CAS with use of a distal filter device (n = 279) were prospectively entered into an investigational carotid registry. Recorded variables were classified as patient-, lesion-, or procedure-related. The filter was assessed for visible debris in each case. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined for each variable to predict visible debris. The ability of each variable to predict the absence of visible debris was assessed by calculating the individual negative predictive value (NPV). Visible debris was present in 169 filters (60.3%). There was an increased risk of visible debris found with several variables (OR, 95% CI): hypertension (2.9, 1.7 to 5.2), hypercholesterolemia (2.3, 1.4 to 3.9), stent diameter>9 mm (16.6, 9.0 to 30.0), and any neurologic event (4.2, 1.5 to 9.9).

The most common suicide gene is coded for the herpes simplex type I thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK), which converts nontoxic nucleoside analogs such as ganciclovir into toxic triphosphated compounds. This study evaluated the potential of this treatment for gene therapy of liver tumors. The sensitivity of different colon carcinoma and hepatoma cell lines to infection by recombinant retroviruses was evaluated. Next, HSV1-TK-expressing derivatives of these cells were generated to analyze their sensitivity to ganciclovir. Finally, these cells were used to generate experimental hepatomas in rats after injection under the liver capsule, and the efficacy and safety of a ganciclovir treatment on tumor growth and survival were evaluated. All the different cell lines analyzed were sensitive to retroviral-mediated gene transfer, although the susceptibility of individual cell lines to this transfer varied significantly. HSV1-TK derivatives were about 1000-fold more sensitive to the toxic effects of ganciclovir than parental cells. Tumors with HSV1-TK expressing MCA-RH8994 hepatoma cells were then generated. Intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg ganciclovir twice daily for 5 days dramatically reduced the size of HSV1-TK-positive tumors compared with tumor size in untreated control rats (0.4 mm3 versus 65 mm3, p<0.02). A long-term study demonstrated that this reduction of tumor volume was associated with a significant increase in survival (p<0.01). Pathologic examination 26 days after the end of ganciclovir injections showed that complete tumor regression was observed in two of five rats. Most important, there was no toxicity associated with these tumors.",

In a prospective, interventional trial, a standardized protocol for low-risk chest pain was implemented at each site. A total of 553 consecutively hospitalized low-risk patients with chest pain were enrolled during a 3-month baseline period followed by a standardized 6-month intervention period. During the intervention period, each patient's physician was contacted about eligibility for discharge within the specified 2-day guideline period. Guideline adherence (discharged within 48 hours) and postdischarge patient outcomes were measured. Local guideline champions were interviewed about their implementation experience. Guideline adherence during the intervention period ranged from 61% to 100%, with only two sites achieving significant increases of>or = 10% from the baseline values. Guideline implementation did not affect clinical outcomes or patient satisfaction. Implementation factors such as preexisting hospital environment, implementation team staffing, and the rapid identification and resolution of barriers may influence the successful translation of guidelines into practice.",

        "ContextString": "Answer the question based on the following context: A retrospective study of abdominal CT scans of patients with proved intraabdominal desmoid tumors was done to determine if any objective characteristics exist to differentiate desmoids related to Gardner's syndrome from isolated desmoids. Because the desmoid tumors of Gardner's syndrome can predate the diagnosis of Gardner's syndrome, it would be helpful to know which patients with desmoids need careful follow-up studies as well as initial workup for Gardner's syndrome and all its ramifications. Also, it would be important to differentiate benign from malignant desmoids associated with Gardner's syndrome. It was hoped that the location, enhancement characteristics, and/or the presence or absence of infiltration might be of value. We were interested in noting if, over time, the growth characteristics of desmoids found in Gardner's syndrome were different from those of isolated desmoids. We reviewed 101 abdominal CT scans obtained in 23 patients during a 13-year period. Forty desmoid tumors were intraabdominal, including 30 lesions associated with Gardner's syndrome in 13 patients and 10 desmoids of the idiopathic form in 10 patients. These tumors were studied to define location; whether they were single or multiple; and whether they had any specific CT characteristics regarding margins, attenuation numbers, or contrast enhancement. Desmoid tumors associated with Gardner's syndrome were more likely to be multiple (38%, five of 13 patients) and to involve the mesentery (60%, 18 of 30 tumors) and the abdominal wall (40%, 12 of 30 tumors), whereas isolated desmoid tumors were singular (all 10 patients) and were located in the retroperitoneum (six cases), pelvis (three), and anterior wall (one). Desmoids related to Gardner's syndrome also tended to be smaller (mean diameter, 4.8 cm) than idiopathic desmoids (mean diameter, 13.8 cm). No differentiating CT characteristics regarding margins, attenuation numbers, or response to contrast material were ascertained. Ten new lesions (seven intraabdominal, three mesenteric) developed in three patients with Gardner's syndrome, whereas no new intraabdominal lesions developed in patients with idiopathic desmoids. Follow-up data on 16 surgically resected desmoids in nine patients (seven with Gardner's syndrome and two with isolated desmoids) revealed seven local recurrences (two in the two patients with isolated desmoids and five in two patients with Gardner's syndrome).",

Patient's residual renal function (RRF) was assessed by the average renal urea and creatinine clearances. Those patients who had more than 50% decrease in GFR were selected for the present analysis. Serum albumin (ALB), dietary protein intake (DPI) and subjective global assessment (SGA) were closely followed. There were 16 patients (9 males and 7 females) included in the present analysis, among whom 31.3% were diabetics.

The goal of this study was to determine how often radiographic findings change postoperative care. A total of 227 consecutive patients aged 10 to 21 years who underwent surgery for IS at our institution from 2004 to 2010 were identified. Charts were reviewed to determine the frequency of the following clinical symptoms during the first year after surgery: pain greater than expected, implant prominence, and sensory/motor disturbance. Radiographs were reviewed to identify implant failure and curve change. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify clinical symptoms associated with treatment deviation. During the first year after surgery, an average of 6 (range, 2 to 12) radiographs were obtained from patients during an average of 3 (range, 2 to 10) follow-up visits. Pain (14%) was the most common symptom. Neurologic symptoms (13%) and implant prominence (4%) were less common. Implant failure was identified in 4 subjects (2%), of which 3 required revision surgery. The incidence of revision surgery was 2.9/1000 radiographs (95% confidence interval, 0.6-8.3). Curve progression>5 degrees in the uninstrumented curve occurred in 2 patients (0.9%). Curve progression did not result in a change in treatment for any of the patients. Pain was the only clinical symptom associated with implant failure (P=0.0047). 169/227 patients did not have any symptoms and only one of these underwent revision surgery. The sensitivity of a clinical test, which uses the presence of pain to guide the need for radiographic evaluation and rule out implant failure, was 75%, specificity 87%, positive predictive value 10%, and negative predictive value 99.5%.",

To determine the effect of implicit exclusion criteria on a trial study sample, we compared data from the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) trial with data from a retrospective registry from selected hospitals, the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI), and a nationally representative study of myocardial infarction care, the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project (CCP). We compared GUSTO subjects aged 65 years and older who were enrolled in the United States with similarily aged patients in the 2 observational studies who met the trial's eligibility criteria. We examined baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, treatments, procedures, clinical events, and in-hospital mortality rates. We found modest, although significant, differences between patients in NRMI, CCP, and GUSTO in demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome. For example, GUSTO patients were significantly younger (73.1 +/- 5.7 vs 74.7 +/- 6.8 for NRMI and 75.8 +/- 7.2 for CCP), less likely to have Killip class III/IV at presentation (3.1% vs 6.2% for NRMI and 32.7% for CCP), and more likely to receive aspirin (95.5% vs 86.3% for NRMI and 86.5% for CCP) and beta-blockers (71.9% vs 43.5% for NRMI and 52.7% for CCP). Overall, NRMI and CCP patients had a lower risk of 30-day mortality after adjustment for demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics than patients in GUSTO (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.86 for NRMI; odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59-0.71 for CCP).",

The calculation of MTB typically utilizes software to semiautomatically draw volumes of interest around the tumor, which are subsequently manually adjusted by the radiologist to include the entire tumor. The manual adjustment step can be time-consuming and observer-dependent. We compared the agreement of MTB values obtained using the semiautomatic method with and without manual adjustment in NSCLC patients. This IRB-approved prospective study included 134 patients with histologically proven NSCLC who underwent fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography. The MTB of the primary tumor was measured with a semiautomatic gradient-based method without manual adjustment (the semiautomatic gradient method) and with manual adjustment (the manually adjusted semiautomatic gradient method) by two radiologists using the MIM PETedge tool. The paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) were calculated to evaluate the agreement between MTB measures obtained with these two methods, as well as agreement between the two radiologists for each method. Maximum standardized uptake value was identical between the two methods. No statistically significant difference was present for peak standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis values between the two methods (P=0.23, 0.45, and 0.37, respectively).

Mean preoperative expected capacity for age was 60% +/- 18%. Mean postoperative followup was 11.2 years. Postoperatively, 11 patients achieved initial dryness but 9 subsequently presented with recurrent incontinence and 2 presented with upper tract deterioration. Four cases failed the initial bladder outlet procedure. Salvage procedures included augmentation cystoplasty in all 15 patients, combined with repeat bladder outlet procedure in 4 and bladder neck closure in 2. Mean time to augmentation cystoplasty was 39.6 +/- 28 months.",
        "Behavior": "Question: Is long-term bladder deterioration inevitable following successful isolated bladder outlet procedures in children with neuropathic bladder dysfunction?",
        "answer": "Isolated bladder outlet procedures for neurogenic incontinence portend a poor long-term outcome, requiring augmentation cystoplasty despite the use of anticholinergic medications and strict followup. Preoperative urodynamic evaluation does not predict the need or timing from the initial bladder outlet procedure for future augmentation cystoplasty."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between HRT use and women's perceptions of the risk and benefits associated with HRT use. A written questionnaire was administered to 387 women, aged 45 years and older, responding to a health plan invitation for free bone mineral density screening. Women were asked to estimate the lifetime probability of developing breast cancer, uterine cancer, osteoporosis, and myocardial infarction when taking HRT and when not taking HRT. Women rated their quality of life in their current state of health, with breast cancer, with uterine cancer, with osteoporosis, and after myocardial infarction. HRT users perceived a greater risk reduction using HRT compared with HRT nonusers for osteoporosis (-34.9% vs -17.8%, P<.001) and myocardial infarction (-20.7% vs -8.4%, P<.001). HRT nonusers perceived a greater risk increase using HRT compared with HRT nonusers for breast cancer (16.5% vs 3.3%, P<.001) and uterine cancer (9.2% vs 0.6%, P =.004).

However, normal values for age-related bone marrow cellularity in pediatric patients have not been well established. This study was designed to better define pediatric normal values for bone marrow cellularity. A retrospective review of 448 bone marrow core biopsy or clot specimens, including 45 samples from healthy donors, were taken from the posterior iliac crest of patients aged from younger than 1 to 18 years (55% male). All samples were collected and fixed in a standardized fashion. Patients with hematopoietic malignancies and other systemic conditions known to impact marrow cellularity were excluded. The mean cellularity of the entire sample was 65.4%. Cellularity was similar in boys and girls, but varied (p<0.001) with age. Cellularity was highest in patients younger than 2 years (79.8%), and declined in patients 2 to 4 years old (68.6%) and 5 to 9 years old (59.1%). Cellularity remained stable in older patients (60.1% and 61.1%, respectively, in patients 10 to 14 and 15 to 18 years of age).

Analysis of data from the comprehensive surveillance and control program established in Colorado Springs in response to the AIDS epidemic suggests that, unlike the nation's epicenters, HIV incidence in this location is neither widespread nor rapidly increasing. The age distribution of reported cases is slowly increasing, and the ratio of newly reported cases to deaths is declining, implying stable or decreasing incidence; deaths may soon exceed new cases. Using data routinely available to public health officials, we conclude that the epidemiologic picture of AIDS--like the clinical one--must be heterogeneous, and that rational planning for the impact of AIDS should be based on the collection and analysis of local data."

A sample of U.S. Marines was assessed before and after deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan in 2010 or 2011. Within-group centering was used to distinguish unit-level from individual-level associations of cohesion with four behavioral and mental health outcomes assessed after deployment: alcohol misuse, violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a positive screen for depression. Unit-level cohesion is associated positively with alcohol misuse (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.05-3.29) and negatively with UCMJ violations (OR=0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.83) but not with probable PTSD (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.60-1.6) or a positive screen for depression (OR=1.00 95% CI 0.58-1.72).

In a model with a larger \"mastoid\" and an actual pressure range of -46.8 to -93.6 mmH2O tympanometric readings are somewhat less unreliable (error of 40%-20%). However, tympanometry is in error of more than 400% in a model with a small mastoid in which the actual ME pressure is only slightly negative (i.e., range between -3.9 and -46.8 mmH2O).

The interest in using recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) stimulation of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) with positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown, but mainly for patients with high serum thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration. We evaluated the use of rhTSH-stimulated PET-FDG in patients with low serum Tg concentration. Sixty-one PET/computed tomography (CT)-FDG (Biograph Sensation 16; Siemens Medical Solutions, Knoxville, TN) were performed in 44 patients (28 women and 16 men; 51 +/- 16 years) with positive Tg levels, negative or no contributive iodine-131 whole-body scintigraphy results, and no contributive morphological imaging results (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT). Thirty-eight patients had papillary carcinoma and six had follicular thyroid carcinoma. All patients had previously undergone total thyroidectomy and postoperative iodine ablation of thyroid bed remnant tissue. The rhTSH-stimulated PET/CT-FDG (5 MBq/kg) was performed after two 0.9 mg intramuscular doses of rhTSH (Thyrogen; Genzyme) which were administered 48 and 24 hours before imaging, while patients continued levothyroxine (LT(4)). Blood sampling was performed immediately before FDG injection for measurement of serum TSH and Tg concentrations (TSH(1) and Tg(1)) and after 48 hours (TSH(2) and Tg(2)). PET/CT-FDG findings were compared with the Tg: (i) at the initial iodine treatment during T(4) withdrawal (Tg(ini)), (ii) under T(4) (Tg(T4)) within 3 months before the PET/CT-FDG, (iii) with Tg(1), and (iv) with Tg(2). PET/CT-FDG findings were correlated with the findings of histology, iodine-131 whole-body scintigraphy, morphological imaging, or clinical follow-up. The mean Tg(ini) was 785 +/- 2707 microg/L for a TSH of 73 +/- 64 mU/L. The mean Tg(T4) was 7 +/- 15 microg/L (T(4) = 195 +/- 59 microg/day; mean TSH of 0.24 +/- 0.57 mU/L). Among the 44 patients, PET/CT-FDG findings were positive in 20 and negative in 24. Among the 61 PET/CT-FDG, 25 PET/CT-FDG were positive (41%). Among the 25 positive PET, the Tg(T4) values were less than 10 microg/L for 19, including 9 true-positive patients (20% of the 44 patients). There was no difference of PET/CT-FDG results (positive vs. negative) as related to the serum Tg concentrations (p = 0.99 for Tg(ini), p = 0.95 for Tg(T4), p = 0.07 for Tg(1), and p = 0.42 for Tg(2)). No relation was observed with PET/CT-FDG results and initial tumor size (p = 0.52) or node metastasis (p = 0.14).",

However, positive PET-FDG results have been found in 9/44 (20%) patients with serum Tg levels lower than 10 microg/L. Therefore, this series shows that a cutoff value of 10 microg/L for the Tg under T(4) is probably not the best criteria to select patient candidates for PET/CT-FDG examination to detect the recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma."

Patient demographics, stroke severity, neuroimaging and treatment time points were collected. Annual P2P times, defined as the interval between pretreatment neuroimaging (picture) and commencement of intra-arterial therapy (puncture), were assessed and compared. From 2007 to 2013 a total of 189 patients were identified, of which 181 met the study criteria. At initial presentation, median baseline NIH Stroke Severity score was 17.00 (IQR 11.00-22.00).

The patient group was a consecutive series of 470 screening-detected invasive breast cancers that were diagnosed between 1988 and 1998. Data regarding tumor type, grade, maximum invasive diameter, lymph node status, and the presence or absence of vascular invasion were recorded, as were the mammographic features of the lesion. Survival was ascertained from hospital records and a cancer registry. Differences in survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with a log-rank test for difference. The significance of any correlations was assessed using the chi-square test and the chi-square test for trend. Multivariate analysis used a Cox proportional hazards model. At univariate analysis, large invasive size, the presence of definite vascular invasion, high histologic grade, and nodal involvement were associated with poorer breast-cancer-specific survival. Mammographic spiculation (the presence of either a spiculated mass or distortion) was associated with more prolonged breast-cancer-specific survival. The presence or absence of mammographic comedo calcification did not influence breast-cancer-specific survival.

The use of tocolytic agents to stop associated contractions is still somewhat controversial, however, and the number of cases reported to date is small. The purpose of our study was to find a large number of cases of preterm third-trimester bleeding that was treated with tocolytic agents and evaluate them for any evidence of potential harm related to the use of these agents. Every case of third-trimester bleeding for a 6-year period was obtained from a perinatal database that was created as patients were hospitalized. Only cases of patients with onset of bleeding between 23 and 36 weeks' gestation were analyzed. Data collected included the gestational age at the time of first bleeding, the gestational age at delivery, whether tocolytic agents were used, the need for transfusion, maternal morbidity, and neonatal outcome. A total of 236 cases, consisting of 131 cases of abruptio placentae and 105 cases of placenta previa, met the study criteria. In the abruptio placentae group 95 women (73%) were treated with tocolytic agents. In this group the mean gestational age at the time of first bleeding was 28.9 weeks, the mean time from bleeding until delivery was 18.9 days, the median time from bleeding until delivery was 7 days, and the neonatal mortality rate was 51 deaths/1000 live births.

Apart from the risk of intestinal damage following adhesiolysis, to date no information is available on the best way of preventing the formation of new adhesions in the vicinity of the implanted meshes. Numerous experimental investigations, mainly conducted on an open small-animal model, have demonstrated the advantages of coating meshes, inter alia with absorbable materials, compared with uncoated polypropylene meshes. In our established laparoscopic porcine model we set about investigating three of these meshes, which are already available on the market. In total, 18 domestic pigs underwent laparoscopic surgery and three different composite meshes were tested in each case on six animals (Dynamesh IPOM, Proceed, Parietene Composite). At 4 months, postmortem diagnostic laparoscopy was carried out, followed by full-wall excision of the specimens. Planimetric analysis was conducted to investigate the size of the entire surface area and the extent of adhesions. Histological investigations were performed on five sections for each specimen. These focused on the partial volumes of inflammatory cells, the proliferation marker Ki67, apoptotic index, inflammatory cell marker CD68 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) as a marker of the extracellular matrix. A similar value of 14% was obtained for shrinkage of Dynamesh IPOM and Parietene Composite, while Proceed showed a 25% reduction in its surface area. Markedly lower values of 12.8% were obtained for Parietene Composite in respect of adhesions to the greater omentum, compared with 31.7% for Proceed and 33.2% for Dynamesh IPOM (p = 0.01).

Our objective was to identify a deficit in patients with SSD on response to rewarding stimuli and determine whether this deficit predicts cannabis use. We divided a group of patients with SSD and nonpsychotic controls into cannabis users and nonusers. Response to emotional and cannabis-associated visual stimuli was assessed using self-report, event-related potentials (using the late positive potential [LPP]), facial electromyography and skin-conductance response. Our sample comprised 35 patients with SSD and 35 nonpsychotic controls. Compared with controls, the patients with SSD showed blunted LPP response to pleasant stimuli (p = 0.003). Across measures, cannabis-using controls showed greater response to pleasant stimuli than to cannabis stimuli whereas cannabis-using patients showed little bias toward pleasant stimuli. Reduced LPP response to pleasant stimuli was predictive of more frequent subsequent cannabis use (\u03b2 = -0.24, p = 0.034).

One fiber was positioned directly on the skin surface and the second one underneath the skin samples. The distribution of the sunlight under the epidermis was determined. Significant differences were found in the absorption properties of the different skin types, which were mainly determined by the variations in melanin concentration and distribution. It was found that sunscreens for specific ethnic groups need different combinations of UV filters, if a balanced relation between ultraviolet B (UVB) and ultraviolet A (UVA) protection is to be obtained.

        "ContextString": "Answer the question based on the following context: To determine the stability of cytokines in frozen stored amniotic fluid samples, we measured angiogenin, a potent inducer of neovascularization and interleukin-6, an inflammatory cytokine, in the same sample of midtrimester amniotic fluid 1 year apart. In this study paired aliquots of amniotic fluid kept at -70 degrees C were immunoassayed for angiogenin and interleukin-6 at two different time periods 1 year apart. Inclusion criteria were (1) samples with clearly identifiable numbers, (2) no evidence of breaks in sealing of samples, and (3) singleton gestation. Amniotic fluid was immunoassayed for angiogenin and interleukin-6 in July 1995 and 1996. Angiogenin sensitivities were 0.078 and 0.026 ng/ml, interassay coefficients of variation were 3.8% and 4.6%, and intraassay coefficients of variation were 2.7% and 2.9%, respectively, in 1995 and 1996. Interleukin-6 sensitivities were 1.74 and 2.37 pg/ml, interassay coefficients of variation were 8.9% and 2.6%, and intraassay coefficients of variation were 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively, in 1995 and 1996. Statistical analysis included paired t test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and regression with p<0.05 significant. Angiogenin and interleukin-6 values were normalized with natural log transformation for statistical analysis. Paired amniotic fluid samples from 30 patients were immunoassayed from 1993 to 1995. The values of angiogenin were significantly lower in the 1996 assay compared with the 1995 assay (median 12.4 [range 5.6 to 61.3] vs 26.7 [range 13.6 to 159.2]ng/ml, p<0.001). A significant correlation was found between the change in angiogenin levels and the year of the sample, with older samples having the greatest change in values (r=0.5, p=0.008). The values of interleukin-6 were significantly lower in the 1996 assay compared with the 1995 assay (median 230.8 [range 40.9 to 3711.3] vs 289.2 [range 53.7 to 19100.0]pg/ml, p<0.001).",

        "ContextString": "Answer the question based on the following context: Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) often requires technicians to wear multiple protective garments in challenging environmental conditions. The accumulative effect of increased metabolic cost coupled with decreased heat dissipation associated with these garments predisposes technicians to high levels of physiological strain. It has been proposed that a perceptual strain index (PeSI) using subjective ratings of thermal sensation and perceived exertion as surrogate measures of core body temperature and heart rate, may provide an accurate estimation of physiological strain. Therefore, this study aimed to determine if the PeSI could estimate the physiological strain index (PSI) across a range of metabolic workloads and environments while wearing heavy EOD and chemical protective clothing. Eleven healthy males wore an EOD and chemical protective ensemble while walking on a treadmill at 2.5, 4 and 5.5km\u00b7h(-1) at 1% grade in environmental conditions equivalent to wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) 21, 30 and 37\u00b0C. WBGT conditions were randomly presented and a maximum of three randomised treadmill walking trials were completed in a single testing day. Trials were ceased at a maximum of 60-min or until the attainment of termination criteria. A Pearson's correlation coefficient, mixed linear model, absolute agreement and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the relationship between the PeSI and PSI. A significant moderate relationship between the PeSI and the PSI was observed [r=0.77; p<0.001; mean difference=0.8\u00b11.1a.u. (modified 95% limits of agreement -1.3 to 3.0)]. The ROC curves indicated that the PeSI had a good predictive power when used with two, single-threshold cut-offs to differentiate between low and high levels of physiological strain (area under curve: PSI three cut-off=0.936 and seven cut-off=0.841).",
        "Behavior": "Question: Can perceptual indices estimate physiological strain across a range of environments and metabolic workloads when wearing explosive ordnance disposal and chemical protective clothing?",

Four treatment conditions for each subject group in a fully repeated 2 x 2 x 2 measures design. The Human Appetite Research Unit at Leeds University, Psychology Department. Eight lean HF (mean % fat intake-46.7% daily energy) and eight lean LF (mean % fat intake - 29.9% daily energy) were recruited from the staff/student population of Leeds University. All subjects were provided with either a low (2129 kJ) or high (3801 kJ) energy meal at midday and the capacity for compensation was later measured by nutrient challenge (ad libitum consumption of either high fat or high CHO foods). Satiation and satiety were assessed by changes in energy and nutrient intakes, hunger, fullness and food preferences. The energy and nutrient manipulations gave rise to different levels in the rated intensity of hunger between HF and LF (P<0.01). HF rated their baseline hunger at a higher level than LF, and the nutrient induced changes in hunger had a much greater amplitude. HF consumed significantly more energy from the high fat meals than from the high CHO meals (P<0.05); this effect was not observed in LF. HF ate more energy and a greater weight of the high fat foods but less energy and smaller weight of the high CHO foods than did the LF. HF rated the high fat and high CHO foods equally satisfying, tasty and filling, whereas LF indicated a preference for high CHO foods (P<0.05).",
        "Behavior": "Question: Are high-fat and low-fat consumers distinct phenotypes?",
        "answer": "The appetite control in habitual high and low fat consumers is different. HF 'passively overconsume' fat whereas this effect is weak in LF. The HF ate a constant weight of food whereas LF ate a more constant level of energy. HF could not distinguish between high and low fat foods suggesting that they were intrinsically insensitive or 'taste adapted' whereas LF were fat sensitive. The clear differences disclosed in response to signals generated by the characteristics of ingested food (weight, energy, nutrient composition, taste) suggest that habitual high and low fat consumers can be regarded as distinct behavioural phenotypes. The different styles of appetite control could arise from: (a) intrinsic physiological differences, or (b) a system which is adapted to deal with a particular type of diet."

Reasons to contact an author after publication include clarification, access to raw data, and collaboration. However, legitimate questions have been raised regarding whether these responsibilities generally are being met by corresponding authors of biomedical publications.QUESTIONS/ This study aims to establish (1) what proportion of corresponding authors accept the responsibility of correspondence; (2) identify characteristics of responders; and (3) assess email address decay with time. We hypothesize that the response rate is unrelated to journal impact factor. We contacted 450 corresponding authors throughout various fields of biomedical research regarding the availability of additional data from their study, under the pretense of needing these data for a related review article. Authors were randomly selected from 45 journals whose impact factors ranged from 52 to 0; the source articles were published between May 2003 and May 2013. The proportion of corresponding authors who replied, along with author characteristics were recorded, as was the proportion of emails that were returned for inactive addresses; 446 authors were available for final analysis. Fifty-three percent (190/357) of the authors with working email addresses responded to our request. Clinical researchers were more likely to reply than basic/translational scientists (51% [114/225] versus 34% [76/221]; p<0.001). Impact factor and other author characteristics did not differ.

The aim of this study was to test the following hypothesis: Do males with chronic epilepsy and on long-term treatment with AEDs have a lower than expected risk of developing coronary heart disease? The coronary risk profile in 40 male patients with chronic epilepsy, aged 30-50 years, was explored, using an American individual coronary risk factor test program (the Cooper test). We made a survey of the patients' risk factors: total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, blood pressure, body fat percentage, physical fitness, hereditary factors, smoking habits, and degree of stress. Each factor was given a score, and the sum of scores constituted the total coronary risk profile. Eighty men in the same age group, casually selected from an industrial medical service, served as controls. There was no statistically significant difference in the total coronary risk profile between the epilepsy patients and the controls. Nor were there any significant differences among the individual risk factors except for physical fitness level, which was significantly lower among the epilepsy group than among the controls. In the epilepsy group, however, there was a trend toward higher levels of total cholesterol, higher levels of HDL-cholesterol, lower levels of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio, increased body fat percentage, greater heredity and somewhat greater coronary risk score as compared with the healthy controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance.
